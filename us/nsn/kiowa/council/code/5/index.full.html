Whenever a party to any action or proceedings, civil or criminal, or his attorney shall make and file an affidavit that the judge before whom such action or proceeding is to be tried or hear has a bias or prejudice, either against such party or his attorney or in favor of any opposite party to the suit, such judge shall proceed no further therein, except to call in another judge to hear and determine the matter.</p>
                <p>Every such affidavit shall state the facts and the reasons for the belief that such bias or prejudice exists and shall be filed as soon as practicable after the case has been assigned or such bias or prejudice is known. If the judge against whom the affidavit is directed questions the sufficiency of the affidavit, he shall enter an order directing that a copy thereof be forthwith certified to another judge (naming him), which judge shall then pass upon the legal sufficiency of the affidavit. If the judge against whom the affidavit is directed does not question the legal sufficiency of the affidavit, or if the judge to whom the affidavit is certified finds that it is legally sufficient, another judge must be called in to try the case or to determine the matter in question. No party shall be entitled in any case to file more than one affidavit; and no such affidavit shall be filed unless accompanied by a certificate of counsel of record that such affidavit and application are made in good faith.</p>

Every temporary restraining order granted without notice shall be endorsed with the date and hour of issuance; and shall be filed forthwith in the clerk's office and entered of record; shall define the injury and state why it is irreparable and why the order was granted without notice; and shall expire by its terms within such time after entry, not to exceed 15 days, as the court fixes, unless within the time so fixed the order, for good cause shown, is extended for a like period or unless the party against whom the order is directed consents that it may be extended for a longer period. The reasons for the extension shall be entered of record. In case a temporary restraining order is granted without notice, the motion for a preliminary injunction shall be set down for hearing at the earliest possible time and takes precedence over all matters except older matters of the same character; and when the motion comes on for hearing the party who obtained the temporary restraining order shall proceed with the application for a preliminary injunction and, if he does not do so, the court shall dissolve the temporary restraining order. On 2 days notice to the party who obtained the temporary restraining order without notice or on such shorter notice to that party as the court may prescribe, the adverse party may appear and move its dissolution or modification and in that event the court shall proceed to hear and determine such motion as expeditiously as the ends of justice require.</p>

Appropriate relief by habeas corpus proceedings shall be granted whenever it appears to the court that any person is unjustly imprisoned or otherwise unjustly restrained of his liberty. Upon the filing of the complaint the court shall, unless it appears from such complaint or the showing of the plaintiff that he is not entitled to any relief, issue a writ directed to the defendant commanding him to bring the person alleged to be restrained before the court at a time and place therein specified, at which time the Court shall proceed in a summary manner to hear the matter and render judgment accordingly. If the writ is not issued, the court shall state its reasons in writing and file the same with the complaint and shall deliver a copy thereof to the plaintiff. If the defendant cannot be found, or if he does not have such person in custody, the writ (and any other process issued) may be served upon any one having such person in custody, in the manner and with the same effect as if he had been made defendant. in the action.</p>

If such person has been transferred, the defendant must state that fact, and to whom, when the transfer was made, and the reason or authority therefor. The writ shall not be disobeyed for any defect of form or mis-description of the person restrained or the defendant, if enough is stated to show the meaning and intent thereof.</p>
                <p>The person restrained may waive his right to be present at the hearing, in which case the writ shall be modified accordingly. Pending a determination of the matter the court may place such person in the custody of such individual or individuals as may be deemed proper.</p>

                <p>To the extent that it is found that certain necessary court procedures and laws have not been adequately addressed in the Kiowa Tribal District Court Rules, the Kiowa Tribal Code of Civil Procedure or by the Kiowa Tribal Law &amp; Order Code, the Kiowa Judiciary may draw upon the Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure, as well as the Local Court Rules of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma for guidance and application as in the discretion of the Kiowa Judiciary will best serve the efficient and timely dispensing of justice. Only upon a finding that a such void in the Kiowa Codes and Rules is not adequately addressed by the federal rules, may the Kiowa Judiciary then look to employ the Oklahoma Criminal, Civil and Appellate Procedures.</p>
