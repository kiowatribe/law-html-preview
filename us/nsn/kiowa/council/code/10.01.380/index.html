                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> Because of the placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> In order to care for the spouse, or a son, daughter, or parent, of the Employee, if such spouse, son, daughter, or parent has a serious health condition;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> Because of a serious health condition that makes the Employee unable to perform their job functions;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(5)">(5)</span> Because of any qualifying exigency, arising out of the fact that the spouse, or a son, daughter, or parent of the Employee is on covered active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty) in the U.S Armed Forces; or</p>

For example, an Employer (i) may require an Employee to call in, on a daily or less frequent basis, to speak with a particular individual or (ii) may require an Employee to sign a personal certification verifying that s/he took the leave for the medical reason provided.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(f)(7)">(7)</span> Spouses Employed by the Same Employer. In any case in which spouses entitled to leave under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/kiowa/council/resolutions/2023/KL-CY-2023-008#attachments/law/X/6/6.036.03.6" title="">this Section</a> are employed by the same Employer, the aggregate number of workweeks of leave to which both may be entitled may be limited to 12 workweeks during any 12-month period if such leave is taken pursuant to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/kiowa/council/resolutions/2023/KL-CY-2023-008#attachments/law/X/6/6.036.03.3" title="">Section 6.03.3</a>, subparagraph A or B, or to care for a sick parent or to a combined total of 26 weeks of leave during a 12-month period to care for a covered service-member with a serious injury or illness.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(f)(8)">(8)</span> Employee's Substance Abuse. Substance abuse may be a serious health condition in certain instances. However, leave under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/kiowa/council/code/6" title="Title 6 Finance and Economics">Title 6</a> may only be taken for treatment for substance abuse by a health care provider. Absence because of the Employee's use of the substance, rather than for treatment, does not qualify for leave under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/kiowa/council/code/6" title="Title 6 Finance and Economics">Title 6</a>. The rules regarding substance abuse at work always apply.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(f)(9)">(9)</span> Employer's Option to Provide Domestic Partner Family Medical Leave. Any Employer may elect, by policy provided to (and acknowledged by) its employees or by contract with an Employee, to provide Family Medical Leave under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/kiowa/council/code/6" title="Title 6 Finance and Economics">Title 6</a> to care for domestic partners. In that event, such domestic partners shall be treated in the same manner as spouses are treated under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/kiowa/council/code/6" title="Title 6 Finance and Economics">Title 6</a>. To qualify for domestic partner coverage, an employee must have registered their domestic partnership and the name of their domestic partner with the Human Resources Director (or the equivalent employer representative) with the Employer on such forms or affidavits as may be required by the Employer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(f)(10)">(10)</span> Equal Treatment of Spouses and Domestic Partners Who Work for the Same Employer. The restrictions upon spouses of a single employer shall apply to two employees of a single employer who consider themselves "domestic partners."</p>
