                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> APPLICABILITY OF THIS CODE</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> The provisions of the Code apply to all full-time judges. Parts II through V of this section identify those provisions that apply to four distinct categories of part-time judges. The four categories of judicial service in other than a full-time capacity are necessarily defined in general terms because of the widely varying forms of judicial service. Canon 4 applies to judicial candidates.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> A judge, within the meaning of this Code, is anyone who is authorized to perform judicial functions, including an officer such as a justice of the peace, magistrate, court commissioner, special master, referee, or member of the administrative law judiciary.<fn path="|footnotes|1" cache:url="/us/nsn/kiowa/council/code/application#(a)(2)/fn/1" cache:hash="(a)(2)/fn/1" no-wrap="no-wrap">1</fn></p>

                  <strong>COMMENT</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> The Rules in this Code have been formulated to address the ethical obligations of any person who serves a judicial function, and are premised upon the supposition that a uniform system of ethical principles should apply to all those authorized to perform judicial functions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> The determination of which category and, accordingly, which specific Rules apply to an individual judicial officer, depends upon the facts of the particular judicial service.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(5)">(5)</span> In recent years many jurisdictions have created what are often called "problem solving" courts, in which judges are authorized by court rules to act in nontraditional ways. For example, judges presiding in drug courts and monitoring the progress of participants in those courts' programs may be authorized and even encouraged to communicate directly with social workers, probation officers, and others outside the context of their usual judicial role as independent decision makers on issues of fact and law. When local rules specifically authorize conduct not otherwise permitted under these Rules, they take precedence over the provisions set forth in the Code. Nevertheless, judges serving on "problem solving" courts shall comply with this Code except to the extent local rules provide and permit otherwise.</p>
