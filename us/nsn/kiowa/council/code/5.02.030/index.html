                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> <span class="level-heading">WARRANT OF ARREST.</span> A Warrant of Arrest is a written order signed by a Trial Court judge commanding the arrest of any person subject to the jurisdiction of the Kiowa Tribal Courts. The warrant must specify the name of the person, or a description by which the person can be identified with reasonable certainty, if the name of the person is not known. It must also state the offense or offenses charged and the date it was issued. A Warrant of Arrest shall not be valid outside the limits of the Kiowa Tribe's jurisdiction as defined in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/kiowa/council/code/5.01.040#(a)" title="">Section 5.01.040(a)</a> of this Code but shall be subject to extradition as agreed upon between the Tribe and the various foreign jurisdictions.</p>

If the defendant does not waive such rights, or requests legal counsel, the officer must not continue any interrogation.</p>

The defendant arrested shall be arraigned at the next regularly scheduled session of the Court. Any person brought before the Court at the session immediately following the arrest shall be considered to have been presented before the Court without undue delay.</p>
