                <p>WHEREAS,  the Kiowa Tribe (the "Tribe") is organized under a constitution, duly adopted and approved by the voters of the Tribe on April 17, 2017 and approved by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior ("Secretary")(the "Constitution"); and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS,  pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/kiowa/council/constitution" title="Constitution of the Kiowa Tribe">Article VI, Section 6(a) of the Constitution</a>, the Legislature is vested with the authority to pass laws and resolutions, including the power to authorize the Chairman to enter into contracts for financial and banking services; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS,  the Tribe has a need to invest and secure its financial resources; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS,  the Tribe has determined that entering into a contract with the Bank and establishing a banking relationship with the Bank is in the Kiowa Tribe's best financial interest; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS,  the Bank has requested the Tribe to determine who is officially authorized to act as Agents for the Tribe and to exercise certain powers as indicated below;</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED,  that the Legislature hereby authorizes the following persons and positions to be designated agents of the Tribe in all transactions with the Bank:</p>
                <p>Name and Title or Position				Signature</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>Michael Primus</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE  BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the following powers are granted to the persons named above by listing the letter corresponding to their name above before each authority.  The chart below describes each authority, the number of signers needed and any limitations on such authority:</p>
                <p><u>A, B, C</u>	1) Open or close (a) financial account(s) at the Bank in the name of the Tribe. (IF C exercises this power, either A or B must sign).  For a financial account to be closed, a complete reconciliation of that account must be completed by a Certified Public Accountant, who shall attest, under oath, that the account balance was correct at the time of closing.</p>
                <p><u>A, B, C, D, E</u> 	2) Endorse checks and orders for the payment of money or otherwise withdraw or transfer funds on deposit with the Bank.  (If C, D or E exercises this power, either A or B must sign)</p>
                <p><u>A, B</u>	3)  Borrow money on behalf of and in the name of the Tribe from the Bank, and sign, execute and deliver promissory notes or other evidence of indebtedness to the Bank.  This power requires additional prior authorization from the Legislature.  This resolution signifies prior authorization from the Legislature for P-Cards or Credit Cards to be obtained for the signatories above or their designees.</p>
                <p><u>A, B, C, D</u>	4)  Endorse, assign, transfer, mortgage or pledge bills receivable, warehouse receipts, bills of lading, stocks, bonds, real estate or other property to the Bank now owned or hereafter owned or acquired by the Tribe as security for sums borrowed, and to discount the same, unconditionally guarantee payment of all bills received, negotiated or discounted, and to waive demand, presentment, protest, notice of protest and notice of non-payment.</p>
                <p><u>A, B, C, D</u>	5)  Enter into a written lease or other agreement with the Bank for the purpose of maintaining, one or more safe deposit boxes.</p>
                <p><u>F</u>	6) Authorize the Speaker of the Legislature or his Designee Inquiry Authorization for all accounts at the Bank.  This Inquiry Authority may be exercised by the Speaker of the Legislature or his Designee without any other signature nor any additional authorization.</p>
                <p><strong>FINALLY, BE IT RESOLVED, </strong>the Legislature declares:</p>
                <p>The Bank is designated as a depository for the funds of the Kiowa Tribe and is to provide other financial accommodations as indicated by this Resolution;</p>
                <p>This Resolution shall continue to be in full force and effect until express written notice of its recission or modification has been received and recorded by the Bank.  Any revocation, modification or replacement of this resolution must be accompanied by a Resolution from the Legislature, duly promulgated, bearing signatures showing passage, agreement by the Chairman, or a veto-override by the Legislature, and also bearing the official seal of the Legislature;</p>
                <p>The signature of an Agent named this resolution is conclusive evidence of their act on behalf of the Kiowa Tribe subject to the powers and limitations set out above.  Any Agent, so long as they act in a representative capacity as an Agent of the Tribe, is authorized to make any and all other contracts, agreements, stipulations and orders with the Bank which may from time to time be necessary and appropriate to effectuate their authority; however, a signatory may not expand his authority beyond the limits set out in this resolution;</p>
                <p>All transactions, if any, with respect to any deposits, withdrawals, rediscounts, and borrowings by or on behalf of the Tribe with the Bank prior to the adoption of this resolution which have been accounted for to the Legislature in the annual budget process and which have passed review by an independent auditor are hereby ratified, approved and confirmed.</p>
                <p>If signed in accordance with this Resolution, the Bank shall debit or credit the Tribe's account in accord with any agreement between the Tribe and the Bank.  The Bank may also charge the Tribe for all necessary and usual expenses that are set out in any agreement with the Tribe, including checks, drafts, or other orders for the payment of money so long as the charges are reasonable, and comply with the requirements of Kiowa, Federal or any applicable State law and are not deemed illegal or improper by any Court of Law.</p>
                <p>The Tribe acknowledges and agrees that the Bank may furnish at its discretion automated access devices to Agents of the Tribe to facilitate those powers authorized by this resolution or other resolutions in effect at the time of issuance. The term "automated access device" includes, but is not limited to, purchase cards (aka "P-cards), credit cards, automated teller machines (ATM), debit cards, and electronic access to records and statements.</p>
