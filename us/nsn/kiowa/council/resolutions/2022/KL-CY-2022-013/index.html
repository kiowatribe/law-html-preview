                <p>The Tribe recognizes the citizens of the Kiowa Tribe are its most valuable and important resource. The Kiowa Tribe, as a sovereign tribe residing within the United States, reorganized under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (IRA; 25 U.S.C. Â§476), has a constitutional responsibility to oversee and direct their education through educational institutions, to assure their education reflects academic excellence, meets rigorous academic standards, broaden career expectations for all its citizens, and to streamline and improve delivery of educational services.</p>
                <p><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.4">Section 1.4.</span> Findings.</p>
                <p>The Legislature hereby finds and declares that: The goal of all education and training for Tribal Citizens is self-sufficiency in its most comprehensive form. Of critical importance to the Tribe in the achievement of this goal of self-sufficiency is the use and practical application of academic instruction and training by Tribal Citizens towards realizing the attainment of degrees and certifications in their respective career areas. Self-sufficiency of an individual, his/her family, and ultimately the community of which the individual is an integral part is critical to the attainment of this goal of self-sufficiency. However, of primary importance is the development of internal expertise to contribute towards the advancement and progress of the entire Tribe towards self-sufficiency.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.4(a)">(a)</span> Current Kiowa Education Programs are disparate and disconnected without a seamless administrative oversight which could lend itself to more effective functioning with streamlined services to better serve its citizens under one umbrella of administration and,</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.4(b)">(b)</span> The Kiowa Tribal Education Agency shall provide for a single point of contact for its Tribal Citizens to engage the educational process of each and every citizen who needs support of this agency.</p>
