                <p>This Statute shall be called the Kiowa Housing Law.</p>
                <p>Notice to Legislative History: The first tribal legislation concerning the Kiowa Tribe Housing Authority is the KIOWA TRIBE HOUSING AUTHORITY REFORM ACT OF 2017, which authorized the Kiowa Tribe to reform the Tribe's Housing Authority to bring it into compliance with the Constitution and laws of the Tribe, to take full responsibility to assert the Tribe's sovereign authority to address the housing needs of Members of the Tribe, and to abolish the outdated method of subjecting the Tribe's Housing sovereign status to the full or partial control of the State of Oklahoma by operating the Tribe's Housing Authority, in whole or in part, as a State Agency and to assume total assets of the Kiowa Housing Authority. The second piece of tribal legislation on the issue is the Kiowa Tribe Housing Authority Act of 2019. This amendment is made in 2022 to fix certain errors and inaccuracies as noted below. Two versions of this Law are provided. First is one showing the changes, where additions are underlined. The second version is merely clean, where all changes are accepted and it is the clean version which is the official Kiowa Housing Law.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/2(A)">(A)</span> Pursuant to the Kiowa Tribe Constitution, Article VI, Sections 1 and 6, the Kiowa Legislature shall have the power to make laws toward a better government to address the needs of the people, to create commissions, and to establish executive boards. The Legislature therefore created the Kiowa Tribe Housing Authority (hereinafter referred to as the Authority) which is an agency of the Kiowa Tribe having the purposes, powers, and duties as herein or hereafter by law. The Legislature also created the Kiowa Housing Commission as a Constitutional Commission to direct the affairs of the Authority.</p>

A copy of the ordinance duly certified by the Secretary of the Legislature of Kiowa Tribe shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding. The Tribal Courts shall take judicial notice of this Act.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/2(C)">(C)</span> All housing goals shall be documented in the IHP current Kiowa Housing Law, which describes the Authority as the Kiowa Tribally designated Housing Entity (TDHE) and the Recipient as required by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
