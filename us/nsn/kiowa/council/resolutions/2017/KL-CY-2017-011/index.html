                <p>The purpose of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/kiowa/council/resolutions/2017/KL-CY-2017-011#attachments/law" title="">this Act</a> is to reform the Tribe's Housing Authority to bring it into compliance with <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/kiowa/council/constitution" title="Constitution of the Kiowa Tribe">the Constitution</a> and laws of the Tribe, to take full responsibility to assert the Tribe's sovereign authority to address the housing needs of Members of the Tribe, and to abolish the outdated method of subjecting the Tribe's sovereign status to the full or partial control of the State of Oklahoma by operating the Tribe's Housing Authority, in whole or in part, as a State Agency. The purpose of the Act is also to re- establish respect for the Tribe's government, the institutions of government, and <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/kiowa/council/constitution" title="Constitution of the Kiowa Tribe">the Constitution</a> and laws including the duty of the Tribe and its elected officials, as the People's representatives, to oversee and direct the establishment of a Department of Housing and the delivery of housing-related services.</p>
                <p><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.4">Section 1.4.</span> Findings</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.4(a)">(a)</span> In 1965, Oklahoma law established housing authorities for Indian tribes located within Oklahoma as State Agencies for the purpose of receiving federal housing funds ("State Agency Housing Authority") at a time when Indian tribes were not eligible to receive direct federal funding for housing programs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.4(b)">(b)</span> After federal law changed, tribes in Oklahoma, including the Kiowa Tribe, have applied for and have received federal HUD funds directly from the federal government without the need to administer such funds through Oklahoma's State Agency Housing Authority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.4(c)">(c)</span> The Tribe never addressed the confusion over the original State Agency Housing Authority called the Kiowa Housing Authority, and its assets and liabilities, and the Tribe's Housing Authority, which also operates and manages, either directly or as a sub-recipient, the Tribe's HUD funds and housing programs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.4(d)">(d)</span> The Kiowa Housing Authority has been the subject of lengthy and expensive disputes, including litigation before the Oklahoma Supreme Court over the selection and authority of the Housing Authority Board of Commissioners.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.4(e)">(e)</span> The recent instability within the Tribe's government also contributed to the Tribe's and/or Kiowa Housing Authority's inability to properly manage and administer HUD funds, resulting in a sanction against the Tribe requiring the Tribe to repay HUD approximately seven million dollars ($7,000,000.00) in federal funds.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.4(f)">(f)</span> As a result of the improper management and administration of HUD funds, the Kiowa Housing Authority no longer receives any direct funding from HUD, rather, the Tribe has designated DARKO as a TDHE to receive the Tribe's HUD funds, and DARKO provides certain funds to the Kiowa Housing Authority as a sub-recipient.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.4(g)">(g)</span> The Kiowa Housing Authority has few, if any, State Agency Housing Authority assets or liabilities, as the Kiowa Housing Authority programmatic activities and services derive from its status as a sub-recipient of HUD funds.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.4(h)">(h)</span> The Tribe is not an irrelevant party in the provision of housing services to the Members of the Tribe, and in fact, the Tribe, and the Tribe's housing policies and laws are central to the provision of housing services to the Members of the Tribe, especially the Tribe's decision to request and receive HUD funding and to designate DARKO as the a TDHE.</p>
                <p><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.5">Section 1.5.</span> No Effect on Existing Contract</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.5(a)">(a)</span> Nothing in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/kiowa/council/resolutions/2017/KL-CY-2017-011#attachments/law" title="">this Act</a> is intended to alter or amend any existing contract with DARKO.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.5(b)">(b)</span> DARKO, as the Tribe's TDHE, shall provide the Chairman and Legislature with a written report on October 1st and April 1st of each year detailing to the status of the Tribe's HUD funds, all program and administrative expenditures including all fees and payments made to DARKO, and an overall assessment of the Tribe's housing programs and affairs.</p>

The Housing Commission shall have the authority to select or terminate a Director of the Department of Housing, subject to approval of the Chairman; provided that, if the Chairman takes no action to approve the decision of the Housing Commission regarding a Director, then the decision of the Housing Commission shall be deemed approved.
