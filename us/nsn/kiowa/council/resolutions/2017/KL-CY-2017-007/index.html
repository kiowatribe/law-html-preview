                <p class="center ">
                  <strong>FEBRUARY 2007</strong>
                </p>
                <h3 id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/preamble">None</h3>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/preamble(1)">(1)</span> An independent, fair and impartial judiciary is indispensable to our system of justice. The United States legal system is based upon the principle that an independent, impartial, and competent judiciary, composed of men and women of integrity, will interpret and apply the law that governs our society. Thus, the judiciary plays a central role in preserving the principles of justice and the rule of law. Inherent in all the Rules contained in this Code are the precepts that judges, individually and collectively, must respect and honor the judicial office as a public trust and strive to maintain and enhance confidence in the legal system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/preamble(2)">(2)</span> Judges should maintain the dignity of judicial office at all times, and avoid both impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in their professional and personal lives. They should aspire at all times to conduct that ensures the greatest possible public confidence in their independence, impartiality, integrity, and competence.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/preamble(3)">(3)</span> The Model Code of Judicial Conduct establishes standards for the ethical conduct of judges and judicial candidates. It is not intended as an exhaustive guide for the conduct of judges and judicial candidates, who are governed in their judicial and personal conduct by general ethical standards as well as by the Code. The Code is intended, however, to provide guidance and assist judges in maintaining the highest standards of judicial and personal conduct, and to provide a basis for regulating their conduct through disciplinary agencies.</p>
                <h3 id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/scope">None</h3>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/scope(1)">(1)</span> The Model Code of Judicial Conduct consists of four Canons, numbered Rules under each Canon, and Comments that generally follow and explain each Rule. Scope and Terminology sections provide additional guidance in interpreting and applying the Code. An Application section establishes when the various Rules apply to a judge or judicial candidate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/scope(2)">(2)</span> The Canons state overarching principles of judicial ethics that all judges must observe. Although a judge may be disciplined only for violating a Rule, the Canons provide important guidance in interpreting the Rules. Where a Rule contains a permissive term, such as "may" or "should," the conduct being addressed is committed to the personal and professional discretion of the judge or candidate in question, and no disciplinary action should be taken for action or inaction within the bounds of such discretion.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/scope(3)">(3)</span> The Comments that accompany the Rules serve two functions. First, they provide guidance regarding the purpose, meaning, and proper application of the Rules. They contain explanatory material and, in some instances, provide examples of permitted or prohibited conduct. Comments neither add to nor subtract from the binding obligations set forth in the Rules. Therefore, when a Comment contains the term "must," it does not mean that the Comment itself is binding or enforceable; it signifies that the Rule in question, properly understood, is obligatory as to the conduct at issue.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/scope(4)">(4)</span> Second, the Comments identify aspirational goals for judges. To implement fully the principles of this Code as articulated in the Canons, judges should strive to exceed the standards of conduct established by the Rules, holding themselves to the highest ethical standards and seeking to achieve those aspirational goals, thereby enhancing the dignity of the judicial office.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/scope(5)">(5)</span> The Rules of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct are rules of reason that should be applied consistent with constitutional requirements, statutes, other court rules, and decisional law, and with due regard for all relevant circumstances. The Rules should not be interpreted to impinge upon the essential independence of judges in making judicial decisions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/scope(6)">(6)</span> Although the black letter of the Rules is binding and enforceable, it is not contemplated that every transgression will result in the imposition of discipline. Whether discipline should be imposed should be determined through a reasonable and reasoned application of the Rules, and should depend upon factors such as the seriousness of the transgression, the facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the transgression, the extent of any pattern of improper activity, whether there have been previous violations, and the effect of the improper activity upon the judicial system or others.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/scope(7)">(7)</span> The Code is not designed or intended as a basis for civil or criminal liability. Neither is it intended to be the basis for litigants to seek collateral remedies against each other or to obtain tactical advantages in proceedings before a court.</p>
                <h3 id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/terminology">None</h3>
                <p>

                <p>The Application section establishes when the various Rules apply to a judge or judicial candidate.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/application/I.(A)">(A)</span> The provisions of the Code apply to all full-time judges. Parts II through V of this section identify those provisions that apply to four distinct categories of part-time judges. The four categories of judicial service in other than a full-time capacity are necessarily defined in general terms because of the widely varying forms of judicial service. Canon 4 applies to judicial candidates.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/application/I.(B)">(B)</span> A judge, within the meaning of this Code, is anyone who is authorized to perform judicial functions, including an officer such as a justice of the peace, magistrate, court commissioner, special master, referee, or member of the administrative law judiciary.<fn path="|footnotes|1" cache:url="/us/nsn/kiowa/council/resolutions/2017/KL-CY-2017-007#attachments/law-judicial-conduct/application/I.(B)/fn/1" cache:hash="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/application/I.(B)/fn/1" no-wrap="no-wrap">1</fn></p>

                  <strong>COMMENT</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/application/I.(1)">(1)</span> The Rules in this Code have been formulated to address the ethical obligations of any person who serves a judicial function, and are premised upon the supposition that a uniform system of ethical principles should apply to all those authorized to perform judicial functions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/application/I.(2)">(2)</span> The determination of which category and, accordingly, which specific Rules apply to an individual judicial officer, depends upon the facts of the particular judicial service.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/application/I.(3)">(3)</span> In recent years many jurisdictions have created what are often called "problem solving" courts, in which judges are authorized by court rules to act in nontraditional ways. For example, judges presiding in drug courts and monitoring the progress of participants in those courts' programs may be authorized and even encouraged to communicate directly with social workers, probation officers, and others outside the context of their usual judicial role as independent decision makers on issues of fact and law. When local rules specifically authorize conduct not otherwise permitted under these Rules, they take precedence over the provisions set forth in the Code. Nevertheless, judges serving on "problem solving" courts shall comply with this Code except to the extent local rules provide and permit otherwise.</p>

The judge should keep in mind the effect that the judge's participation in settlement discussions may have, not only on the judge's own views of the case, but also on the perceptions of the lawyers and the parties if the case remains with the judge after settlement efforts are unsuccessful. Among the factors that a judge should consider when deciding upon an appropriate settlement practice for a case are (1) whether the parties have requested or voluntarily consented to a certain level of participation by the judge in settlement discussions, (2) whether the parties and their counsel are relatively sophisticated in legal matters, (3) whether the case will be tried by the judge or a jury, (4) whether the parties participate with their counsel in settlement discussions, (5) whether any parties are unrepresented by counsel, and (6) whether the matter is civil or criminal.</p>

In many jurisdictions, the term "recusal" is used interchangeably with the term "disqualification."</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/2/2.11(2)">(2)</span> A judge's obligation not to hear or decide matters in which disqualification is required applies regardless of whether a motion to disqualify is filed.</p>

For example, a judge might be required to participate in judicial review of a judicial salary statute, or might be the only judge available in a matter requiring immediate judicial action, such as a hearing on probable cause or a temporary restraining order. In matters that require immediate action, the judge must disclose on the record the basis for possible disqualification and make reasonable efforts to transfer the matter to another judge as soon as practicable.</p>

If, however, the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned under paragraph (A), or the relative is known by the judge to have an interest in the law firm that could be substantially affected by the proceeding under paragraph (A)(2)(c), the judge's disqualification is required.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/2/2.11(5)">(5)</span> A judge should disclose on the record information that the judge believes the parties or their lawyers might reasonably consider relevant to a possible motion for disqualification, even if the judge believes there is no basis for disqualification.</p>

Judges are uniquely qualified to engage in extrajudicial activities that concern the law, the legal system, and the administration of justice, such as by speaking, writing, teaching, or participating in scholarly research projects. In addition, judges are permitted and encouraged to engage in educational, religious, charitable, fraternal or civic extrajudicial activities not conducted for profit, even when the activities do not involve the law.

For the same reason, a judge's extrajudicial activities must not be conducted in connection or affiliation with an organization that practices invidious discrimination. See Rule 3.6.</p>

Whether an organization practices invidious discrimination is a complex question to which judges should be attentive. The answer cannot be determined from a mere examination of an organization's current membership rolls, but rather, depends upon how the organization selects members, as well as other relevant factors, such as whether the organization is dedicated to the preservation of religious, ethnic, or cultural values of legitimate common interest to its members, or whether it is an intimate, purely private organization whose membership limitations could not constitutionally be prohibited.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/3/3.13(1)">(1)</span> Whenever a judge accepts a gift or other thing of value without paying fair market value, there is a risk that the benefit might be viewed as intended to influence the judge's decision in a case. Rule 3.13 imposes restrictions upon the acceptance of such benefits, according to the magnitude of the risk. Paragraph (B) identifies circumstances in which the risk that the acceptance would appear to undermine the judge's independence, integrity, or impartiality is low, and explicitly provides that such items need not be publicly reported. As the value of the benefit or the likelihood that the source of the benefit will appear before the judge increases, the judge is either prohibited under paragraph (A) from accepting the gift, or required under paragraph (C) to publicly report it.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/3/3.13(2)">(2)</span> Gift-giving between friends and relatives is a common occurrence, and ordinarily does not create an appearance of impropriety or cause reasonable persons to believe that the judge's independence, integrity, or impartiality has been compromised. In addition, when the appearance of friends or relatives in a case would require the judge's disqualification under Rule 2.11, there would be no opportunity for a gift to influence the judge's decision making. Paragraph (B)(2) places no restrictions upon the ability of a judge to accept gifts or other things of value from friends or relatives under these circumstances, and does not require public reporting.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/3/3.13(3)">(3)</span> Businesses and financial institutions frequently make available special pricing, discounts, and other benefits, either in connection with a temporary promotion or for preferred customers, based upon longevity of the relationship, volume of business transacted, and other factors. A judge may freely accept such benefits if they are available to the general public, or if the judge qualifies for the special price or discount according to the same criteria as are applied to persons who are not judges. As an example, loans provided at generally prevailing interest rates are not gifts, but a judge could not accept a loan from a financial institution at below-market interest rates unless the same rate was being made available to the general public for a certain period of time or only to borrowers with specified qualifications that the judge also possesses.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/3/3.13(4)">(4)</span> Rule 3.13 applies only to acceptance of gifts or other things of value by a judge. Nonetheless, if a gift or other benefit is given to the judge's spouse, domestic partner, or member of the judge's family residing in the judge's household, it may be viewed as an attempt to evade Rule 3.13 and influence the judge indirectly. Where the gift or benefit is being made primarily to such other persons, and the judge is merely an incidental beneficiary, this concern is reduced. A judge should, however, remind family and household members of the restrictions imposed upon judges, and urge them to take these restrictions into account when making decisions about accepting such gifts or benefits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/3/3.13(5)">(5)</span> Rule 3.13 does not apply to contributions to a judge's campaign for judicial office.

                <p>
                  <strong>COMMENT</strong>
                </p>
                <p>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.1(1)">(1)</span> Even when subject to public election, a judge plays a role different from that of a legislator or executive branch official. Rather than making decisions based upon the expressed views or preferences of the electorate, a judge makes decisions based upon the law and the facts of every case. Therefore, in furtherance of this interest, judges and judicial candidates must, to the greatest extent possible, be free and appear to be free from political influence and political pressure. This Canon imposes narrowly tailored restrictions upon the political and campaign activities of all judges and judicial candidates, taking into account the various methods of selecting judges.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.1(2)">(2)</span> When a person becomes a judicial candidate, this Canon becomes applicable to his or her conduct.</p>
                <p>PARTICIPATION IN POLITICAL ACTIVITIES</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.1(3)">(3)</span> Public confidence in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary is eroded if judges or judicial candidates are perceived to be subject to political influence. Although judges and judicial candidates may register to vote as members of a political party, they are prohibited by paragraph (A)(1) from assuming leadership roles in political organizations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.1(4)">(4)</span> Paragraphs (A)(2) and (A)(3) prohibit judges and judicial candidates from making speeches on behalf of political organizations or publicly endorsing or opposing candidates for public office, respectively, to prevent them from abusing the prestige of judicial office to advance the interests of others. See Rule 1.3. These Rules do not prohibit candidates from campaigning on their own behalf, or from endorsing or opposing candidates for the same judicial office for which they are running. See Rules 4.2(B)(2) and 4.2(B)(3).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.1(5)">(5)</span> Although members of the families of judges and judicial candidates are free to engage in their own political activity, including running for public office, there is no "family exception" to the prohibition in paragraph (A)(3) against a judge or candidate publicly endorsing candidates for public office. A judge or judicial candidate must not become involved in, or publicly associated with, a family member's political activity or campaign for public office. To avoid public misunderstanding, judges and judicial candidates should take, and should urge members of their families to take, reasonable steps to avoid any implication that they endorse any family member's candidacy or other political activity.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.1(6)">(6)</span> Judges and judicial candidates retain the right to participate in the political process as voters in both primary and general elections. For purposes of this Canon, participation in a caucus-type election procedure does not constitute public support for or endorsement of a political organization or candidate, and is not prohibited by paragraphs (A)(2) or (A)(3).</p>
                <p>STATEMENTS AND COMMENTS MADE DURING A CAMPAIGN FOR JUDICIAL OFFICE</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.1(7)">(7)</span> Judicial candidates must be scrupulously fair and accurate in all statements made by them and by their campaign committees. Paragraph (A)(11) obligates candidates and their committees to refrain from making statements that are false or misleading, or that omit facts necessary to make the communication considered as a whole not materially misleading.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.1(8)">(8)</span> Judicial candidates are sometimes the subject of false, misleading, or unfair allegations made by opposing candidates, third parties, or the media. For example, false or misleading statements might be made regarding the identity, present position, experience, qualifications, or judicial rulings of a candidate. In other situations, false or misleading allegations may be made that bear upon a candidate's integrity or fitness for judicial office. As long as the candidate does not violate paragraphs (A)(11), (A)(12), or (A)(13), the candidate may make a factually accurate public response. In addition, when an independent third party has made unwarranted attacks on a candidate's opponent, the candidate may disavow the attacks, and request the third party to cease and desist.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.1(9)">(9)</span> Subject to paragraph (A)(12), a judicial candidate is permitted to respond directly to false, misleading, or unfair allegations made against him or her during a campaign, although it is preferable for someone else to respond if the allegations relate to a pending case.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.1(10)">(10)</span> Paragraph (A)(12) prohibits judicial candidates from making comments that might impair the fairness of pending or impending judicial proceedings. This provision does not restrict arguments or statements to the court or jury by a lawyer who is a judicial candidate, or rulings, statements, or instructions by a judge that may appropriately affect the outcome of a matter.</p>
                <p>PLEDGES, PROMISES, OR COMMITMENTS INCONSISTENT WITH IMPARTIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE ADJUDICATIVE DUTIES OF JUDICIAL OFFICE</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.1(11)">(11)</span> The role of a judge is different from that of a legislator or executive branch official, even when the judge is subject to public election. Campaigns for judicial office must be conducted differently from campaigns for other offices. The narrowly drafted restrictions upon political and campaign activities of judicial candidates provided in Canon 4 allow candidates to conduct campaigns that provide voters with sufficient information to permit them to distinguish between candidates and make informed electoral choices.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.1(12)">(12)</span> Paragraph (A)(13) makes applicable to both judges and judicial candidates the prohibition that applies to judges in Rule 2.10(B), relating to pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of judicial office.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.1(13)">(13)</span> The making of a pledge, promise, or commitment is not dependent upon, or limited to, the use of any specific words or phrases; instead, the totality of the statement must be examined to determine if a reasonable person would believe that the candidate for judicial office has specifically undertaken to reach a particular result. Pledges, promises, or commitments must be contrasted with statements or announcements of personal views on legal, political, or other issues, which are not prohibited. When making such statements, a judge should acknowledge the overarching judicial obligation to apply and uphold the law, without regard to his or her personal views.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.1(14)">(14)</span> A judicial candidate may make campaign promises related to judicial organization, administration, and court management, such as a promise to dispose of a backlog of cases, start court sessions on time, or avoid favoritism in appointments and hiring. A candidate may also pledge to take action outside the courtroom, such as working toward an improved jury selection system, or advocating for more funds to improve the physical plant and amenities of the courthouse.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.1(15)">(15)</span> Judicial candidates may receive questionnaires or requests for interviews from the media and from issue advocacy or other community organizations that seek to learn their views on disputed or controversial legal or political issues. Paragraph (A)(13) does not specifically address judicial responses to such inquiries. Depending upon the wording and format of such questionnaires, candidates' responses might be viewed as pledges, promises, or commitments to perform the adjudicative duties of office other than in an impartial way. To avoid violating paragraph (A)(13), therefore, candidates who respond to media and other inquiries should also give assurances that they will keep an open mind and will carry out their adjudicative duties faithfully and impartially if elected. Candidates who do not respond may state their reasons for not responding, such as the danger that answering might be perceived by a reasonable person as undermining a successful candidate's independence or impartiality, or that it might lead to frequent disqualification. See Rule 2.11.</p>

Although lawyers and others who might appear before a successful candidate for judicial office are permitted to make campaign contributions, the candidate should instruct his or her campaign committee to be especially cautious in connection with such contributions, so they do not create grounds for disqualification if the candidate is elected to judicial office. See Rule 2.11.</p>
                <h4 id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.5">RULE 4.5 Activities of Judges Who Become Candidates for Nonjudicial Office</h4>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.5(A)">(A)</span> Upon becoming a candidate for a nonjudicial elective office, a judge shall resign from judicial office, unless permitted by law* to continue to hold judicial office.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.5(B)">(B)</span> Upon becoming a candidate for a nonjudicial appointive office, a judge is not required to resign from judicial office, provided that the judge complies with the other provisions of this Code.</p>

                  <strong>COMMENT</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.5(1)">(1)</span> In campaigns for nonjudicial elective public office, candidates may make pledges, promises, or commitments related to positions they would take and ways they would act if elected to office. Although appropriate in nonjudicial campaigns, this manner of campaigning is inconsistent with the role of a judge, who must remain fair and impartial to all who come before him or her. The potential for misuse of the judicial office, and the political promises that the judge would be compelled to make in the course of campaigning for nonjudicial elective office, together dictate that a judge who wishes to run for such an office must resign upon becoming a candidate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law-judicial-conduct/4/4.5(2)">(2)</span> The "resign to run" rule set forth in paragraph (A) ensures that a judge cannot use the judicial office to promote his or her candidacy, and prevents post-campaign retaliation from the judge in the event the judge is defeated in the election. When a judge is seeking appointive nonjudicial office, however, the dangers are not sufficient to warrant imposing the "resign to run" rule.</p>
