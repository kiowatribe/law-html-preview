(b) This law provides the Kiowa Tribe with the authority to manage Kiowa Tribe affairs, including developing and administering programs and services that were once managed by the federal government. This type of relationship allows the Kiowa Tribe greater control over the Tribe's own destiny, providing it with the opportunity to create sustainable economic opportunities for tribal citizens that are both culturally relevant and economically viable. (c) Additionally, as a 477 Self Governance Tribe, the Kiowa Tribe can form partnerships with other organizations to expand tribal reach, such as public and private entities, that can benefit both the Kiowa Tribe and its citizenship by providing access to resources and knowledge. Through this type of relationship, the Kiowa Tribe can shape its own future while maintaining control over Kiowa culture and traditions. By taking control of the Kiowa Tribe's own destiny, it will ensure a brighter future for Kiowa citizens and the generations to come.", "num": "KL-CY-2023-012", "path": "library|us/nsn/kiowa/council/resolutions|2023|Kiowa Tribe Res.

The second piece of tribal legislation on the issue is the Kiowa Tribe Housing Authority Act of 2019. This amendment is made in 2022 to fix certain errors and inaccuracies as noted below. Two versions of this Law are provided. First is one showing the changes, where additions are underlined.

HOUSING AUTHORITY CREATED (A) Pursuant to the Kiowa Tribe Constitution, Article VI, Sections 1 and 6, the Kiowa Legislature shall have the power to make laws toward a better government to address the needs of the people, to create commissions, and to establish executive boards. The Legislature therefore created the Kiowa Tribe Housing Authority (hereinafter referred to as the Authority) which is an agency of the Kiowa Tribe having the purposes, powers, and duties as herein or hereafter by law. The Legislature also created the Kiowa Housing Commission as a Constitutional Commission to direct the affairs of the Authority. (B) In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any of its contracts, the Authority shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers upon proof of the adoption of this ordinance. A copy of the ordinance duly certified by the Secretary of the Legislature of Kiowa Tribe shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding. The Tribal Courts shall take judicial notice of this Act. (C) All housing goals shall be documented in the IHP current Kiowa Housing Law, which describes the Authority as the Kiowa Tribally designated Housing Entity (TDHE) and the Recipient as required by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.", "num": "KL-CY-2023-001", "path": "library|us/nsn/kiowa/council/resolutions|2023|Kiowa Tribe Res.

Purpose The Tribe recognizes the citizens of the Kiowa Tribe are its most valuable and important resource. The Kiowa Tribe, as a sovereign tribe residing within the United States, reorganized under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (IRA; 25 U.S.C. \u00a7476), has a constitutional responsibility to oversee and direct their education through educational institutions, to assure their education reflects academic excellence, meets rigorous academic standards, broaden career expectations for all its citizens, and to streamline and improve delivery of educational services. Section 1.4. Findings. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that: The goal of all education and training for Tribal Citizens is self-sufficiency in its most comprehensive form. Of critical importance to the Tribe in the achievement of this goal of self-sufficiency is the use and practical application of academic instruction and training by Tribal Citizens towards realizing the attainment of degrees and certifications in their respective career areas. Self-sufficiency of an individual, his/her family, and ultimately the community of which the individual is an integral part is critical to the attainment of this goal of self-sufficiency. However, of primary importance is the development of internal expertise to contribute towards the advancement and progress of the entire Tribe towards self-sufficiency. (a) Current Kiowa Education Programs are disparate and disconnected without a seamless administrative oversight which could lend itself to more effective functioning with streamlined services to better serve its citizens under one umbrella of administration and, (b) The Kiowa Tribal Education Agency shall provide for a single point of contact for its Tribal Citizens to engage the educational process of each and every citizen who needs support of this agency. Section 1.5. Kiowa Tribal Education Agency 1. This Act establishes its TEA in order to achieve this goal of self-sufficiency, the Kiowa Tribe declares that an appropriate education for its Tribal Citizens is one that promotes and encourages the following: a. The formulation of age, grade, and/or developmentally appropriate competencies in all basic areas of academic and cognitive skills; b. Development of Tribal citizenship; c. Self-discipline, self-determination, and positive self-concept; d. A comprehension and promotion of tribal culture, language, values; and e. An attitude towards education which encourages lifelong learning. 2. This Education Code provides for accountability from all those involved in the education process: the participant, the parents, education providers, the Tribal Education Agency, the Tribal government, and the community. 3. The Tribe shall commit sufficient resources, funds, and/or monies towards the achievement of the education goal and the implementation of these policies set forth in this Education Code. In addition, this Education Code shall serve to assure the members of the Kiowa Tribe that the funds committed to education are spent for that purpose in a fair and equitable manner. 4. Whenever reference is made to any portion of this Education Code, the Constitution or other Ordinances of the Kiowa Tribe, or of any law of the State of Oklahoma, or the laws of the United States, such reference applies to all amendments and additions now or hereafter made. 5. Title, division, part, chapter, article, and section headings do not in any manner affect the scope, meaning, or intent of the provisions of this Education Code. 6. If any provision of this Education Code, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the remainder of the Education Code, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby. 7. Whenever a power is granted to, or a duty is imposed upon, an officer of the Tribal Education Agency, the power may be exercised or the duty may be performed by a deputy of the officer or by a person authorized, pursuant to Tribal law, by the officer, unless this Education Code expressly provides otherwise. 8. Words giving a joint authority to three or more Tribal or public officers or other persons are construed as giving such authority to the majority of them, unless it is otherwise expressed in the provisions of the Education Code giving the authority. 9. Unless the provisions or the context otherwise requires, these general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions shall govern the construction of this Education Code.", "num": "KL-CY-2022-013", "path": "library|us/nsn/kiowa/council/resolutions|2022|Kiowa Tribe Res.

(b) Qualified employees receive benefits as part of their employment with the Tribe including retirement, health insurance, and dental and eye care benefits.

Any contract signed or entered into in violation of this Act or in violation of the Constitution, which shall include the arrangement with the New Benefits Provider, shall be null and void ab initio , and the Existing Benefits Provider shall continue to serve as the Tribe's and KCOA's benefits provider, and the services of the Existing Benefits Provider shall not be cancelled until a benefits provider is selected and ratified in accordance with the requirements of this Act. (e) Nothing in this Act is intended to select or otherwise direct the Chairman to select any particular company or entity to provide employee benefits. This Act is not a private law.

Rhonda J. Ahhaitty, Secretary of the Kiowa Tribe Legislature Section 1.1. Short Title This enactment shall be known as the \"Kiowa Housing Authority Reform Act 2017\" (\"Act\"). Section 1.2. Definitions (a) \"Chairman\" shall mean the Chairman of the Kiowa Tribe. (b) \"Constitution\" means the Constitution approved by the voters of the Tribe and the BIA on May 5, 2017. (c) \"DARKO\" means Darko Affordable Housing Solutions, LLC. (d) \"HUD\" means the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. (e) \"Kiowa Housing Authority\" means the entity which operates out of the Housing Authority offices at 1701 East Central Boulevard, Anadarko, Oklahoma, 73005, and serves as a sub-recipient of certain HUD federal funds authorized by the Tribe and provided to DARKO as Tribe's Tribally-Designated Housing Entity, and which otherwise operates and manages, in whole or in part, the Tribe's housing programs and services, or any other housing programs or services. (f) \"Legislature\" means the Legislature of the Kiowa Tribe. (g) \"TDHE\" means the tribally-designated housing entity. (h) \"Tribe\" means the Kiowa Tribe. Section 1.3. Purpose The purpose of this Act is to reform the Tribe's Housing Authority to bring it into compliance with the Constitution and laws of the Tribe, to take full responsibility to assert the Tribe's sovereign authority to address the housing needs of Members of the Tribe, and to abolish the outdated method of subjecting the Tribe's sovereign status to the full or partial control of the State of Oklahoma by operating the Tribe's Housing Authority, in whole or in part, as a State Agency. The purpose of the Act is also to re- establish respect for the Tribe's government, the institutions of government, and the Constitution and laws including the duty of the Tribe and its elected officials, as the People's representatives, to oversee and direct the establishment of a Department of Housing and the delivery of housing-related services. Section 1.4. Findings (a) In 1965, Oklahoma law established housing authorities for Indian tribes located within Oklahoma as State Agencies for the purpose of receiving federal housing funds (\"State Agency Housing Authority\") at a time when Indian tribes were not eligible to receive direct federal funding for housing programs. (b) After federal law changed, tribes in Oklahoma, including the Kiowa Tribe, have applied for and have received federal HUD funds directly from the federal government without the need to administer such funds through Oklahoma's State Agency Housing Authority. (c) The Tribe never addressed the confusion over the original State Agency Housing Authority called the Kiowa Housing Authority, and its assets and liabilities, and the Tribe's Housing Authority, which also operates and manages, either directly or as a sub-recipient, the Tribe's HUD funds and housing programs. (d) The Kiowa Housing Authority has been the subject of lengthy and expensive disputes, including litigation before the Oklahoma Supreme Court over the selection and authority of the Housing Authority Board of Commissioners. (e) The recent instability within the Tribe's government also contributed to the Tribe's and/or Kiowa Housing Authority's inability to properly manage and administer HUD funds, resulting in a sanction against the Tribe requiring the Tribe to repay HUD approximately seven million dollars ($7,000,000.00) in federal funds. (f) As a result of the improper management and administration of HUD funds, the Kiowa Housing Authority no longer receives any direct funding from HUD, rather, the Tribe has designated DARKO as a TDHE to receive the Tribe's HUD funds, and DARKO provides certain funds to the Kiowa Housing Authority as a sub-recipient. (g) The Kiowa Housing Authority has few, if any, State Agency Housing Authority assets or liabilities, as the Kiowa Housing Authority programmatic activities and services derive from its status as a sub-recipient of HUD funds. (h) The Tribe is not an irrelevant party in the provision of housing services to the Members of the Tribe, and in fact, the Tribe, and the Tribe's housing policies and laws are central to the provision of housing services to the Members of the Tribe, especially the Tribe's decision to request and receive HUD funding and to designate DARKO as the a TDHE. Section 1.5. No Effect on Existing Contract (a) Nothing in this Act is intended to alter or amend any existing contract with DARKO. (b) DARKO, as the Tribe's TDHE, shall provide the Chairman and Legislature with a written report on October 1st and April 1st of each year detailing to the status of the Tribe's HUD funds, all program and administrative expenditures including all fees and payments made to DARKO, and an overall assessment of the Tribe's housing programs and affairs. Section 1.6. Establishment of the Department of Housing (a) The Department of Housing is hereby established and shall be located with the Executive branch of government in accordance with Article VII, Section 1(c) of the Constitution. The Department of Housing shall include all housing programs, services, and housing entities of the Tribe including the Kiowa Housing Authority. The Kiowa Housing Authority shall be known as the Department of Housing and shall no longer be autonomous or semi-autonomous from the Tribe. (b) The Legislature hereby directs the Chairman to take any and all actions necessary to undertake, manage, and control the Kiowa Housing Authority, and to continue to provide housing programs for the benefit of the Members of the Tribe. (c) The Department of Housing shall operate and manage any and all Housing and Housing-related programs of the Tribe in compliance with the Constitution, laws, and budgets of the Tribe, and in compliance with all legal requirements that may be imposed as a condition of receiving HUD funds or any other funds. (d) The Department of Housing shall take all steps necessary to prepare the Tribe and the Department to apply for and receive HUD funds and other funds directly from the funding sources upon the expiration of the current contract with DARKO so that DARKO will no longer be needed as the Tribe's tribally-designated housing entity; provided, that the Department of Housing may continue to contract with DARKO to provide limited and short-term consulting services as needed and as authorized by the Housing Commission. Section 1.7. Establishment of Housing Commission (a) The Housing Commission is hereby established and shall be located within the Executive branch of government in accordance with Article VI, Section 6(h) of the Constitution. The Housing Commission shall consist of five members selected upon nomination by the Chairman and confirmation by the Legislature. (b) The Housing Commission shall have the authority to oversee and regulate the Department of Housing including establishing standards and procedures to operate the Department, and authorizing contracts for the Department including any local cooperative agreements for payments in lieu of taxes as authorized by HUD. The Housing Commission shall have the authority to select or terminate a Director of the Department of Housing, subject to approval of the Chairman; provided that, if the Chairman takes no action to approve the decision of the Housing Commission regarding a Director, then the decision of the Housing Commission shall be deemed approved. The Housing Commission shall have the authority to promulgate regulations governing the operation of the Department of Housing. Section 1.8. Oklahoma Law Encourages Tribes to Manage Housing Programs (a) Oklahoma law states in pertinent part, \"In the interest of the sovereign power of federally recognized Indian tribes, economy of efforts, and the maintenance of cooperative relationships between the state and federally recognized Indian tribes, and in light of the above findings, the state hereby authorizes any federally recognized Indian tribe, band or nation for whose benefit a state agency housing authority was or may be created, to assume management and control of the state agency Indian housing authority and all its assets, as provided in this section.\" See , 63 OS 1057 (2010). (b) Oklahoma law establishes a process for tribes to fully assume all management, assets, liabilities, and control of any State Agency Housing Authority designated for an Indian tribe by enacting a Resolution or law to undertake the management and control of the State Agency Housing Authority in accordance with the requirements of such law; and, (2) filing the Resolution or law with the Oklahoma Secretary of State, Oklahoma Attorney General, and with the appropriate County Clerk. (c) The Kiowa Housing Authority has not received any direct funding from HUD for some time, and the Kiowa Housing Authority does not currently receive any direct funding from HUD, i.e., any federal funds that the Kiowa Housing Authority receives comes from its status as a sub-recipient of HUD funds provided to DARKO. (d) Nothing in this Act authorizes the Chairman or Department of Housing to request any additional lands to be taken into trust with the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs or to request any change in any tax status of any real property. (e) The Legislature hereby directs the Chairman to take any and all actions necessary to undertake, manage, and control the State Agency Housing Authority as may be required, including assuming both the assets and liabilities of the State Agency Housing Authority and the Kiowa Housing Authority, to continue to provide housing programs for the benefit of the Members of the Tribe. Section 1.9. Authorization of Appropriation of Funds The Legislature hereby authorizes an appropriation of funds to be included in the Annual Budget or Budget Modification for expenditure to implement this Act.", "num": "KL-CY-2017-011", "path": "library|us/nsn/kiowa/council/resolutions|2017|Kiowa Tribe Res.
