{"body": "Kiowa Code of Law 2.03.030 Findings The Legislature hereby finds and declares that: (a) A 477 Self-Governance Tribe is a special relationship between the United States government and an Indian tribe that allows the tribes to take control of its own destiny and self-governance. This type of relationship is established through legislation, such as the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975. (b) This law provides the Kiowa Tribe with the authority to manage Kiowa Tribe affairs, including developing and administering programs and services that were once managed by the federal government. This type of relationship allows the Kiowa Tribe greater control over the Tribe's own destiny, providing it with the opportunity to create sustainable economic opportunities for tribal citizens that are both culturally relevant and economically viable. (c) Additionally, as a 477 Self Governance Tribe, the Kiowa Tribe can form partnerships with other organizations to expand tribal reach, such as public and private entities, that can benefit both the Kiowa Tribe and its citizenship by providing access to resources and knowledge. Through this type of relationship, the Kiowa Tribe can shape its own future while maintaining control over Kiowa culture and traditions. By taking control of the Kiowa Tribe's own destiny, it will ensure a brighter future for Kiowa citizens and the generations to come. ( Kiowa Tribe Res.

(b) PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE; EFFECT: REASONABLE DOUBT; DEFENDANT'S REFUSAL TO TESTIFY; DEFENDANT'S WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE PRESENT . A defendant in a criminal action need not testify and is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proven. The effect of this presumption is only to place upon the Tribe the burden of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant's failure to testify on his own behalf shall in no way be construed against him nor commented upon by the Tribe. When a defendant has waived his right to be present at trial, the Court, in its discretion, may allow the Tribe to comment upon the defendant's absence and waiver.

In the absence of such stipulation, the jury shall be discharged, and a new jury shall be empaneled to hear the case. (g) LAW QUESTIONS FOR COURT AND FACT QUESTIONS FOR JURY.

The judge shall inform counsel of his proposed action upon each request prior to the arguments to the jury, but the judge shall deliver his instructions to the jury after arguments are completed.

Objections must be given out of the hearing of the jury. (i) POLL OF JURY BEFORE RECORDING VERDICT; EITHER PARTY AUTHORIZED; DISSENTING JUROR; FURTHER DELIBERATION; DISMISSAL OF JURY.

If upon returning after further deliberation, the jury is polled again and a juror answers that the verdict is not his own, then the judge shall dismiss the jury and a new trial will be ordered. (j) DIRECTION OF VERDICT OF ACQUITTAL. At any time after the evidence on either side is closed, the Court may, upon motion of the defendant or upon its own motion, direct the jury to return a verdict of acquittal; and in the event of the failure of the jury to return such a verdict of acquittal, the Court may refuse to receive any other verdict and may discharge the jury and enter a judgment of acquittal.

{"body": "Kiowa Code of Law 5.03.250 JUDGMENT: COSTS. (a) Definition. A judgment includes any final order from which an appeal is available and no special form of judgment is required. (b) Judgment on Multiple Claims. When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, however designated, a final judgment may be entered on less than all of such claims only upon the Court's specifically finding that such is justified. Absent such a finding, an order or decision will not terminate the action as to any of the claims until all claims are finally decided, nor will the appeal period commence to run. (c) Demand for Judgment. (1) Generally. Except in the case of a default judgment, every final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if such relief is not demanded in the pleadings. It may be given for or against one or more of several claimants; and it may, if justice so requires, determine the ultimate rights of the parties on each side as between or among themselves. (2) Judgment by Default. A judgment by default shall not be different in kind from, or exceed in amount, that specifically prayed for in the demand for judgment. (d) Costs. Unless the court shall otherwise direct, the court shall allow necessary costs and disbursements to the prevailing party or parties as a matter of course. Such prevailing party shall file with the court a verified memorandum of his costs and necessary disbursements within five (5) days of the entry of judgment and serve a copy of such on the opposing party, and if such are not objected to within 10 days, they shall be deemed to be a part of and included in the judgment rendered. The Supreme Court may award costs in a like manner. Costs shall not be awarded against the Kiowa Tribe by either the trial or Supreme Court without the consent of the Tribe. (e) Attorney Fees. The court shall not award attorney fees in a case unless such have been specifically provided for by a contract or agreement of the parties under dispute, or unless it reasonably appears that the case has been prosecuted for purposes of harassment only, or that there was no reasonable expectation of success on the part of the affirmatively claiming party.

An injunction may be granted: (1) When it appears by the pleadings on file that a party is entitled to the relief demanded, and such relief, or any part thereof, consists in restraining the commission or continuance of some act complained of, either for a limited period or perpetually. (2) When it appears from the pleadings or by affidavit that the commission or continuance of some act during the litigation would produce great or irreparable injury to the party seeking injunctive relief. (3) When it appears during the litigation that either party is doing or threatens, or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act of violation of the rights of another party respecting the subject matter of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.

If the writ is not issued, the court shall state its reasons in writing and file the same with the complaint and shall deliver a copy thereof to the plaintiff. If the defendant cannot be found, or if he does not have such person in custody, the writ (and any other process issued) may be served upon any one having such person in custody, in the manner and with the same effect as if he had been made defendant. in the action. The defendant shall appear at the proper time and place with the person designated or show good cause for not doing so and must answer the complaint within the time allowed.

The person restrained may waive his right to be present at the hearing, in which case the writ shall be modified accordingly. Pending a determination of the matter the court may place such person in the custody of such individual or individuals as may be deemed proper. (c) Habeas Corpus; Decision. In each case, the court, upon determining the case, shall enter specific findings of fact and conclusions of law and judgment, in writing, and the same shall be made a part of the record in the case. If the court finds in favor of the complainant, it shall enter an appropriate order with respect to judgment or sentence in the former proceedings and such further orders with respect to re- arraignment, retrial, custody, bail, or discharge as the court may deem just and proper in the case. (d) Habeas Corpus Availability. Except in cases of extraordinary injustice, habeas corpus relief shall not be available to a person incarcerated as a result of a criminal conviction where the alleged grounds for relief have been or could have been raised by an appeal following the conviction.

{"body": "Kiowa Code of Law 5.04.010 PREAMBLE (a) An independent, fair and impartial judiciary is indispensable to our system of justice. The United States legal system is based upon the principle that an independent, impartial, and competent judiciary, composed of men and women of integrity, will interpret and apply the law that governs our society. Thus, the judiciary plays a central role in preserving the principles of justice and the rule of law. Inherent in all the Rules contained in this Code are the precepts that judges, individually and collectively, must respect and honor the judicial office as a public trust and strive to maintain and enhance confidence in the legal system. (b) Judges should maintain the dignity of judicial office at all times, and avoid both impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in their professional and personal lives. They should aspire at all times to conduct that ensures the greatest possible public confidence in their independence, impartiality, integrity, and competence. (c) The Model Code of Judicial Conduct establishes standards for the ethical conduct of judges and judicial candidates. It is not intended as an exhaustive guide for the conduct of judges and judicial candidates, who are governed in their judicial and personal conduct by general ethical standards as well as by the Code. The Code is intended, however, to provide guidance and assist judges in maintaining the highest standards of judicial and personal conduct, and to provide a basis for regulating their conduct through disciplinary agencies.

{"body": "Kiowa Code of Law 5.04.020 SCOPE (a) The Model Code of Judicial Conduct consists of four Canons, numbered Rules under each Canon, and Comments that generally follow and explain each Rule. Scope and Terminology sections provide additional guidance in interpreting and applying the Code. An Application section establishes when the various Rules apply to a judge or judicial candidate. (b) The Canons state overarching principles of judicial ethics that all judges must observe. Although a judge may be disciplined only for violating a Rule, the Canons provide important guidance in interpreting the Rules. Where a Rule contains a permissive term, such as \"may\" or \"should,\" the conduct being addressed is committed to the personal and professional discretion of the judge or candidate in question, and no disciplinary action should be taken for action or inaction within the bounds of such discretion. (c) The Comments that accompany the Rules serve two functions. First, they provide guidance regarding the purpose, meaning, and proper application of the Rules. They contain explanatory material and, in some instances, provide examples of permitted or prohibited conduct. Comments neither add to nor subtract from the binding obligations set forth in the Rules. Therefore, when a Comment contains the term \"must,\" it does not mean that the Comment itself is binding or enforceable; it signifies that the Rule in question, properly understood, is obligatory as to the conduct at issue. (d) Second, the Comments identify aspirational goals for judges. To implement fully the principles of this Code as articulated in the Canons, judges should strive to exceed the standards of conduct established by the Rules, holding themselves to the highest ethical standards and seeking to achieve those aspirational goals, thereby enhancing the dignity of the judicial office. (e) The Rules of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct are rules of reason that should be applied consistent with constitutional requirements, statutes, other court rules, and decisional law, and with due regard for all relevant circumstances. The Rules should not be interpreted to impinge upon the essential independence of judges in making judicial decisions. (f) Although the black letter of the Rules is binding and enforceable, it is not contemplated that every transgression will result in the imposition of discipline. Whether discipline should be imposed should be determined through a reasonable and reasoned application of the Rules, and should depend upon factors such as the seriousness of the transgression, the facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the transgression, the extent of any pattern of improper activity, whether there have been previous violations, and the effect of the improper activity upon the judicial system or others. (g) The Code is not designed or intended as a basis for civil or criminal liability. Neither is it intended to be the basis for litigants to seek collateral remedies against each other or to obtain tactical advantages in proceedings before a court. ( Kiowa Tribe Res.

{"body": "Kiowa Code of Law 5.04.040 APPLICATION The Application section establishes when the various Rules apply to a judge or judicial candidate. (a) APPLICABILITY OF THIS CODE (1) The provisions of the Code apply to all full-time judges. Parts II through V of this section identify those provisions that apply to four distinct categories of part-time judges. The four categories of judicial service in other than a full-time capacity are necessarily defined in general terms because of the widely varying forms of judicial service. Canon 4 applies to judicial candidates. (2) A judge, within the meaning of this Code, is anyone who is authorized to perform judicial functions, including an officer such as a justice of the peace, magistrate, court commissioner, special master, referee, or member of the administrative law judiciary. 1 COMMENT (3) The Rules in this Code have been formulated to address the ethical obligations of any person who serves a judicial function, and are premised upon the supposition that a uniform system of ethical principles should apply to all those authorized to perform judicial functions. (4) The determination of which category and, accordingly, which specific Rules apply to an individual judicial officer, depends upon the facts of the particular judicial service. (5) In recent years many jurisdictions have created what are often called \"problem solving\" courts, in which judges are authorized by court rules to act in nontraditional ways. For example, judges presiding in drug courts and monitoring the progress of participants in those courts' programs may be authorized and even encouraged to communicate directly with social workers, probation officers, and others outside the context of their usual judicial role as independent decision makers on issues of fact and law. When local rules specifically authorize conduct not otherwise permitted under these Rules, they take precedence over the provisions set forth in the Code. Nevertheless, judges serving on \"problem solving\" courts shall comply with this Code except to the extent local rules provide and permit otherwise. II. RETIRED JUDGE SUBJECT TO RECALL A retired judge subject to recall for service, who by law is not permitted to practice law, is not required to comply: (b) with Rule 3.9 (Service as Arbitrator or Mediator), except while serving as a judge; or (c) at any time with Rule 3.8 (Appointments to Fiduciary Positions). COMMENT (d) For the purposes of this section, as long as a retired judge is subject to being recalled for service, the judge is considered to \"perform judicial functions.\" III. CONTINUING PART-TIME JUDGE A judge who serves repeatedly on a part-time basis by election or under a continuing appointment, including a retired judge subject to recall who is permitted to practice law (\"continuing part-time judge\"), (e) is not required to comply: (1) with Rules 2.10(A) and 2.10(B) (Judicial Statements on Pending and Impending Cases), except while serving as a judge; or (2) at any time with Rules 3.4 (Appointments to Governmental Positions), 3.8 (Appointments to Fiduciary Positions), 3.9 (Service as Arbitrator or Mediator), 3.10 (Practice of Law), 3.11 (Financial, Business, or Remunerative Activities), 3.14 (Reimbursement of Expenses and Waivers of Fees or Charges), 3.15 (Reporting Requirements), 4.1 (Political and Campaign Activities of Judges and Judicial Candidates in General), 4.2 (Political and Campaign Activities of Judicial Candidates in Public Elections), 4.3 (Activities of Candidates for Appointive Judicial Office), 4.4 (Campaign Committees), and 4.5 (Activities of Judges Who Become Candidates for Nonjudicial Office); and (f) shall not practice law in the court on which the judge serves or in any court subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the court on which the judge serves, and shall not act as a lawyer in a proceeding in which the judge has served as a judge or in any other proceeding related thereto. COMMENT (g) When a person who has been a continuing part-time judge is no longer a continuing part-time judge, including a retired judge no longer subject to recall, that person may act as a lawyer in a proceeding in which he or she has served as a judge or in any other proceeding related thereto only with the informed consent of all parties, and pursuant to any applicable Model Rules of Professional Conduct. An adopting jurisdiction should substitute a reference to its applicable rule. IV. PERIODIC PART-TIME JUDGE A periodic part-time judge who serves or expects to serve repeatedly on a part-time basis, but under a separate appointment for each limited period of service or for each matter, (h) is not required to comply: (1) with Rule 2.10 (Judicial Statements on Pending and Impending Cases), except while serving as a judge; or (2) at any time with Rules 3.4 (Appointments to Governmental Positions), 3.7 (Participation in Educational, Religious, Charitable, Fraternal, or Civic Organizations and Activities), 3.8 (Appointments to Fiduciary Positions), 3.9 (Service as Arbitrator or Mediator), 3.10 (Practice of Law), 3.11 (Financial, Business, or Remunerative Activities), 3.13 (Acceptance and Reporting of Gifts, Loans, Bequests, Benefits, or Other Things of Value), 3.15 (Reporting Requirements), 4.1 (Political and Campaign Activities of Judges and Judicial Candidates in General), and 4.5 (Activities of Judges Who Become Candidates for Nonjudicial Office); and (i) shall not practice law in the court on which the judge serves or in any court subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the court on which the judge serves, and shall not act as a lawyer in a proceeding in which the judge has served as a judge or in any other proceeding related thereto. V. PRO TEMPORE PART-TIME JUDGE A pro tempore part-time judge who serves or expects to serve once or only sporadically on a part-time basis under a separate appointment for each period of service or for each case heard is not required to comply: (j) except while serving as a judge, with Rules 1.2 (Promoting Confidence in the Judiciary), 2.4 (External Influences on Judicial Conduct), 2.10 (Judicial Statements on Pending and Impending Cases), or 3.2 (Appearances before Governmental Bodies and Consultation with Government Officials); or (k) at any time with Rules 3.4 (Appointments to Governmental Positions), 3.6 (Affiliation with Discriminatory Organizations), 3.7 (Participation in Educational, Religious, Charitable, Fraternal, or Civic Organizations and Activities), 3.8 (Appointments to Fiduciary Positions), 3.9 (Service as Arbitrator or Mediator), 3.10 (Practice of Law), 3.11 (Financial, Business, or Remunerative Activities), 3.13 (Acceptance and Reporting of Gifts, Loans, Bequests, Benefits, or Other Things of Value), 3.15 (Reporting Requirements), 4.1 (Political and Campaign Activities of Judges and Judicial Candidates in General), and 4.5 (Activities of Judges Who Become Candidates for Nonjudicial Office). VI. TIME FOR COMPLIANCE A person to whom this Code becomes applicable shall comply immediately with its provisions, except that those judges to whom Rules 3.8 (Appointments to Fiduciary Positions) and 3.11 (Financial, Business, or Remunerative Activities) apply shall comply with those Rules as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than one year after the Code becomes applicable to the judge. COMMENT (l) If serving as a fiduciary when selected as judge, a new judge may, notwithstanding the prohibitions in Rule 3.8, continue to serve as fiduciary, but only for that period of time necessary to avoid serious adverse consequences to the beneficiaries of the fiduciary relationship and in no event longer than one year. Similarly, if engaged at the time of judicial selection in a business activity, a new judge may, notwithstanding the prohibitions in Rule 3.11, continue in that activity for a reasonable period but in no event longer than one year.

(2) The Tribe, through its Legislature, finds that the formation of tribally-owned corporations will serve the best interests of the Tribe, its members and its enterprises, and will protect the political integrity, economic security and health and welfare of the Tribe and its members by, among other things: (A) Creating a legal structure which provides for the segregation of the Tribe's governmental assets and liabilities from the Tribe's business assets and liabilities; and (B) Creating a legal structure which provides for the segregation of discrete Corporation assets and liabilities into separate Corporation subdivisions, without divesting either the Corporation or the Tribe of the privileges and immunities arising pursuant to their legal status under federal and tribal law.

(b) An eligible Employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered service- member shall be entitled to a total of 26 workweeks of leave during a 12-month period to care for the service- member with a serious injury or illness, as defined in Section 6.03.3 , below. The leave described in this paragraph shall only be available during a single 12-month period. (c) Authorized Reasons for Tribal Family Medical Leave - Eligible Employees may use Family Medical Leave for one or more of the following reasons: (1) Because of the birth of a son or daughter of the Employee, in order to care for such son or daughter; (2) Because of the placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care; (3) In order to care for the spouse, or a son, daughter, or parent, of the Employee, if such spouse, son, daughter, or parent has a serious health condition; (4) Because of a serious health condition that makes the Employee unable to perform their job functions; (5) Because of any qualifying exigency, arising out of the fact that the spouse, or a son, daughter, or parent of the Employee is on covered active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty) in the U.S Armed Forces; or (6) To care for a covered service-member with a serious injury or illness if the Employee is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of the covered service-member. (d) The entitlement to leave under subparagraphs A) and B), above, for a birth or placement of a son or daughter shall expire at the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date of such birth or placement. The right to take leave under Title 6 applies equally to male and female Employees. Thus, a father, as well as a mother, can take family leave for the birth, placement for adoption, or foster care of a child provided that they are \"caring\" for the child. (e) Nature of Leave Requirement - Family Medical Leave granted under Title 6 is unpaid leave. An eligible Employee may elect, or an employer may require the employee, to substitute any accrued paid time off (including vacation leave, sick leave, medical leave bank, extended illness bank, and floating holidays) of the Employee for leave provided under this section . (f) Conditions - The following conditions apply to Family Medical Leave granted under this section : (1) Notice. The Employee must give at least 30 calendar days' notice of the intended date upon which the medical leave will commence and terminate, unless prevented by a medical emergency from giving that notice. Where it is not possible for an Employee to provide 30 calendar days' notice, the Employee must provide notice to the employer as soon as possible. The following requirements shall apply with regard to the Employee's notice: (A) The Employee's notice shall specify the reasons for the requested leave, shall state the anticipated duration of the leave, and shall state the anticipated start date of the leave; (B) The Employee's notice shall be directed to Human Resources Department; and (C) In any case in which the leave is due to the covered active duty of a family member, the Employee shall provide such notice as soon as possible; (2) Certification. The employer may require that requests for leave for the Employee's own serious health condition or to care for a family member's serious health condition be supported by a certification issued by a health care provider. The health care provider shall not have a familial relationship with the Employee or have a close working relationship with the Employee as determined at the discretion of the Human Resources Director. The employer may also require that an Employee's leave because of a qualifying exigency or to care for a covered service-member with a serious injury or illness be supported by a certification. Upon request of the employer, the Employee shall provide, in a timely manner, a certification containing all the following information: (A) The date on which the serious health condition commenced; (B) The probable duration of the condition; (C) The appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider regarding the condition; (D) For purposes of leave to care for a family member, (i) a statement that the eligible Employee is needed to care for the son, daughter, spouse, or parent and (ii) an estimate of the amount of time that such Employee is needed to care for the son, daughter, spouse, or parent; and (E) For purposes of leave for the Employee's own serious health condition, a statement that the Employee is unable to perform the functions of the position of the Employee; (F) In the case of certification for intermittent leave, or leave on a reduced leave schedule, for planned medical treatment, (i) the dates on which such treatment is expected to be given and (ii) the duration of such treatment; (G) In the case of certification for intermittent leave, or leave on a reduced leave schedule, for the Employee's own serious health condition, (i) a statement that the particular leave schedule is medically necessary and (ii) the expected duration of the leave schedule; (H) In the case of certification for intermittent leave, or leave on a reduced leave schedule, for the Employee to care for another with a serious health condition, (i) a statement that the particular leave schedule is necessary for the care of the son, daughter, parent, or spouse with the condition, or (ii) a statement that the leave will assist in their recovery, and the expected duration of the leave schedule; and (I) In the case of leave taken to care for a covered service-member, a certification completed by an authorized health care provider of the covered service-member (Department of Defense provider, Veterans Affairs provider, TRICARE provider), (i) a statement as to whether the injury or illness was incurred in the line of duty on active duty, (ii) the approximate date on which the serious injury or illness commenced, or was aggravated, and its probable duration, (iii) a statement or description of appropriate medical facts regarding the health condition for which Family Medical Leave is requested, (iv) information sufficient to established that the covered service-member is in need of care; (J) In the case of leave taken because of a qualifying exigency, (i) a copy of the military member's active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military which indicates that the military member is on covered active duty or call to covered activity status, and the dates of the military member's covered active duty service, and (ii) a signed certification from the Employee setting forth: the facts regarding the qualifying exigency for which leave is requested, the approximate date on which the qualifying exigency commenced or will commence, the beginning and end dates for such leave, if leave will be taken intermittently, an estimate of the frequency and duration of the qualifying exigency, if the qualifying exigency involves meeting with a third party, appropriate contact information for the individual which whom the Employee is meeting and a brief description of the purpose of the meeting, and if the qualifying exigency involves rest and recuperation leave, a copy of the military orders, which indicates that the military member has been granted such leave and the dates of the leave. (K) If an Employee fails to provide the required certification, or fails to cure any defects (incomplete or vague entries) in a required certification within 7 calendar days after notice by the Employer of such defects, then the Employer shall be authorized to deny the leave request made by the Employee. (3) Second Opinions. In any case in which the Employer has a reasonable basis to doubt the validity of the medical certification provided, the Employer may require, at its own expense, that the Employee obtain the opinion of a second health care provider designated or approved by the Employer concerning any information certified under subsection 2. of this section for such leave. A health care provider designated or approved under this subsection 3. shall not be employed on a regular basis by the Employer. In the event that the second opinion differs from the opinion in the original certification, the Employer and Employee shall jointly designate a third health care provider to provide a third opinion, which opinion shall be considered final and binding on the Employee and the Employer. (4) Recertification. The Employer may require the Employee to obtain re-certifications on a reasonable basis. (5) Obligation to Schedule Medical Treatment with Employer's Interests in Mind. In every case in which the necessity for leave is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, the Employee shall make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to disrupt the operations of the employer. This requirement applies whether the leave is necessary for the Employee's own serious health condition or to care for a family member with a serious health condition. (6) Intermittent or Reduced Scheduled Leave. The following conditions apply to leave taken on an intermittent basis or on a reduced schedule: (A) Leave taken to due to the birth of a son or daughter or as a result of placement of a son or daughter with the Employee for adoption or foster care may not be taken by an Employee intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule, unless the Employer agrees; (B) Leave taken due to one's own serious health condition or to care for a family member with a serious health condition may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule, but only when it is medically necessary as certified by a health care provider; (C) If an Employee requests intermittent leave, or leave on a reduced leave schedule, for any reason specified in subsection B of this section , the Employer may require the Employee to transfer temporarily to an alternative position for which the Employee is qualified if such new position (i) has equivalent pay and benefits and (ii) better accommodates recurring periods of leave than the Employee's regular position; and (D) An Employee who is taking leave on an intermittent basis or on a reduced schedule shall comply with the Employer's usual notice or procedural requirements for calling in absences and requesting leave. For example, an Employer (i) may require an Employee to call in, on a daily or less frequent basis, to speak with a particular individual or (ii) may require an Employee to sign a personal certification verifying that s/he took the leave for the medical reason provided. (7) Spouses Employed by the Same Employer. In any case in which spouses entitled to leave under this Section are employed by the same Employer, the aggregate number of workweeks of leave to which both may be entitled may be limited to 12 workweeks during any 12-month period if such leave is taken pursuant to Section 6.03.3 , subparagraph A or B, or to care for a sick parent or to a combined total of 26 weeks of leave during a 12-month period to care for a covered service-member with a serious injury or illness. (8) Employee's Substance Abuse. Substance abuse may be a serious health condition in certain instances. However, leave under Title 6 may only be taken for treatment for substance abuse by a health care provider. Absence because of the Employee's use of the substance, rather than for treatment, does not qualify for leave under Title 6 . The rules regarding substance abuse at work always apply. (9) Employer's Option to Provide Domestic Partner Family Medical Leave. Any Employer may elect, by policy provided to (and acknowledged by) its employees or by contract with an Employee, to provide Family Medical Leave under Title 6 to care for domestic partners. In that event, such domestic partners shall be treated in the same manner as spouses are treated under Title 6 . To qualify for domestic partner coverage, an employee must have registered their domestic partnership and the name of their domestic partner with the Human Resources Director (or the equivalent employer representative) with the Employer on such forms or affidavits as may be required by the Employer. (10) Equal Treatment of Spouses and Domestic Partners Who Work for the Same Employer. The restrictions upon spouses of a single employer shall apply to two employees of a single employer who consider themselves \"domestic partners.\" ( Kiowa Tribe Res.

Except as provided herein, any Employee who exercises the right to Family Medical Leave under Title 6 , on return from such leave, is entitled to be restored by the Employer to the position held by the Employee when the leave commenced or to an equivalent position with equivalent Employee benefits, pay and other terms and conditions of employment.

The purpose of this Act is to authorize and direct the Chairman to acquire additional lands for housing and economic development purposes for the benefit of the Tribe and the People. Article 3 Findings. The Legislature finds and declares that: Section 3.1. historically, the Tribe controlled vast areas of land that sustained the People; however, over time, the Tribe's land base has been greatly diminished by harmful Federal laws and policies, fraudulent transfers, and theft; and Section 3.2. It is in the best interests of the Tribe to acquire additional lands, including available allotments, in order to expand the Tribe's land base and territory, Article 4 Authorization and Place Land into Trust Section 4.1. The Legislature hereby authorizes the Chairman or his designee to acquire land subject to approval by the legislature and appropriation for such purposes. Section 4.2. To obtain approval from the Legislature, the Chairman shall provide written notice to the Speaker of the Legislature. If the Legislature does not respond within 20 days, approval will be deemed given. If the legislature wishes to consider the matter before approval is considered, then the Speaker shall so notify the Chairman in writing, and the matter shall be taken up at the next regularly monthly session of the Kiowa Legislature in accordance with the Kiowa Constitution Article VI Section 7(a) , and approval for the transaction shall require an affirmative, majority vote of the quorum of the Legislature. Section 4.3. In making such appropriations, the Legislature may make restrictions on the total amount expended for a particular tract of land, including per acre limitations on the amount expended. Section 4.4. In the process of purchasing such land, an attorney must be consulted, and before the land can be purchased the attorney shall state in writing to the legislature and the Chairman that: a. Title to be conveyed to the Kiowa Tribe is sufficient to satisfy the United States in an action under 25 U.S.C. part 151; b. A phase 1 environmental review reveals no impairments to the land to be purchased; c. If the land includes buildings, a structural inspection of the buildings shows they are in reasonable working order; and d. the other requirements of 25 U.S.C. part 151 likely can be met when the Kiowa Tribe seeks to put the land into trust. Article 5 Duty to Apply for Trust Status. Unless the Chairman specifies the land shall not be placed immediately into trust when he provides initial notice to the Speaker under Article 4 , above, within 180 days of acquiring title of property purchased under this Act , the Chairman or his designee shall file with the United States an application to take the land into trust. Article 6 Savings Clause Both the requirements of this law and the requirements of \"KL-CY-2018-003 Economic Development Due Diligence Act of 2018\" , must be met when real estate is being purchased for economic development reasons.

(c) Additionally, as a 477 Self Governance Tribe, the Kiowa Tribe can form partnerships with other organizations to expand tribal reach, such as public and private entities, that can benefit both the Kiowa Tribe and its citizenship by providing access to resources and knowledge. Through this type of relationship, the Kiowa Tribe can shape its own future while maintaining control over Kiowa culture and traditions.

If any court determines that any of the agreements, representations and covenants of this Appendix A, or any part thereof, are invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Appendix A shall not thereby be affected and shall be given full effect, without regard to the invalid or unenforceable portions and such invalid or unenforceable portions shall be deemed, without further action on the part of the Corporation and Insider, modified, amended and limited to the extent necessary to render the same valid and enforceable in such jurisdiction. Moreover, if any court determines that any of the agreements, representations or covenants of this Appendix A, or any part thereof, are unenforceable because of the duration or geographic scope of such provisions, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable.", "num": "KL-CY-2023-011", "path": "library|us/nsn/kiowa/council/resolutions|2023|Kiowa Tribe Res.

Methods to resolve disputes through early settlement, including mediation. 4.01.3 The integrity of Chapter 2 of this title is threatened if parties bypass the procedures, rights, and remedies established therein and seek, instead, to invoke procedures or remedies outside of the Tribe's law and jurisdiction for controversies that Chapter 2 of this title is designed to address and resolve in accordance with the unique public policies of the Tribe. Investigations or proceedings directed at Employers, apart from those provided for by Chapter 2 of this Title , which seek to address controversies or rights covered by that Chapter, require the expenditure of time and resources to the detriment of those involved and, in many instances, to the Tribe or its Entities.

For the purposes of subsection 4. 05. 1 , above, Employees shall be deemed to have \"failed to exhaust their remedies provided by any provisions of Chapter 2 of this Act \" if they have failed to exhaust the procedures, rights, remedies, and appeals (including opportunities to challenge jurisdiction) available under Chapter 2 of this Act or the procedures of the Court, and have, instead, invoked investigations or proceedings outside of those authorized by Chapter 2 of this Title to: A. Address controversies or rights covered by this Act , such as unfair labor practices and proceedings for enforcement of the Tribe's wages and hours laws this Act , or B. Challenge the assertion of jurisdiction under Chapter 2 of this Title . Section 4.06. Actions for Injunctive Relief to Prevent Disclosures. The Court shall have authority to grant preliminary and permanent injunctions, upon motion to prevent Employer disclosures in violation of subsection 4.05 , above, and the sovereign immunity of Employers from such actions is hereby waived for the sole purpose of granting non-monetary equitable relief. Section 4.07. Authority of the Court to Resolve Jurisdictional Disputes.

Except as provided herein, any Employee who exercises the right to Family Medical Leave under this Chapter , on return from such leave, is entitled to be restored by the Employer to the position held by the Employee when the leave commenced or to an equivalent position with equivalent Employee benefits, pay and other terms and conditions of employment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Chapter , an Employer may deny restoration under this section to any Employee if the Employee obtains Family Medical Leave fraudulently, or in the following circumstances: A. If the Employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time reinstatement is requested (for example, if an Employee is laid off, if the Employee's shift has been eliminated, or if the Employee was hired for a specific term or only to perform work on a discrete project and that term/project has expired or been completed); B.

The taking of Family Medical Leave under this Chapter shall not result in the loss of any Employee benefit accrued before the date on which the leave commenced. However, an Employee has no greater right to benefits and conditions of employment than if the Employee had been continuously employed during the leave period. In accordance with the policies of the Tribe, Employees who are out on unpaid leave pursuant to this Chapter shall not be entitled to accrue paid time off while on leave. 6.08.2 Limitations.

A written claim filed pursuant to the grievance procedure outlined in the Employer's Personnel Policy Manual. B. In the event there is no Personnel Policy Manual, the Employee shall file a written claim with the Employer's human resources manager and if there is no human resources manager, the Tribe's Human Resources Director. The claim shall be initially reviewed by the Human Resources Manager/Director and the Employee's immediate supervisor for a decision.

That the Employer must cease and desist from engaging in a violation of this Chapter ; B. A directive to the Employer to cease and desist from engaging in a violation of this Chapter ; C.

Purpose The Tribe recognizes the citizens of the Kiowa Tribe are its most valuable and important resource. The Kiowa Tribe, as a sovereign tribe residing within the United States, reorganized under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (IRA; 25 U.S.C. \u00a7476), has a constitutional responsibility to oversee and direct their education through educational institutions, to assure their education reflects academic excellence, meets rigorous academic standards, broaden career expectations for all its citizens, and to streamline and improve delivery of educational services. Section 1.4. Findings. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that: The goal of all education and training for Tribal Citizens is self-sufficiency in its most comprehensive form. Of critical importance to the Tribe in the achievement of this goal of self-sufficiency is the use and practical application of academic instruction and training by Tribal Citizens towards realizing the attainment of degrees and certifications in their respective career areas. Self-sufficiency of an individual, his/her family, and ultimately the community of which the individual is an integral part is critical to the attainment of this goal of self-sufficiency. However, of primary importance is the development of internal expertise to contribute towards the advancement and progress of the entire Tribe towards self-sufficiency. (a) Current Kiowa Education Programs are disparate and disconnected without a seamless administrative oversight which could lend itself to more effective functioning with streamlined services to better serve its citizens under one umbrella of administration and, (b) The Kiowa Tribal Education Agency shall provide for a single point of contact for its Tribal Citizens to engage the educational process of each and every citizen who needs support of this agency. Section 1.5. Kiowa Tribal Education Agency 1. This Act establishes its TEA in order to achieve this goal of self-sufficiency, the Kiowa Tribe declares that an appropriate education for its Tribal Citizens is one that promotes and encourages the following: a. The formulation of age, grade, and/or developmentally appropriate competencies in all basic areas of academic and cognitive skills; b. Development of Tribal citizenship; c. Self-discipline, self-determination, and positive self-concept; d. A comprehension and promotion of tribal culture, language, values; and e. An attitude towards education which encourages lifelong learning. 2. This Education Code provides for accountability from all those involved in the education process: the participant, the parents, education providers, the Tribal Education Agency, the Tribal government, and the community. 3. The Tribe shall commit sufficient resources, funds, and/or monies towards the achievement of the education goal and the implementation of these policies set forth in this Education Code. In addition, this Education Code shall serve to assure the members of the Kiowa Tribe that the funds committed to education are spent for that purpose in a fair and equitable manner. 4. Whenever reference is made to any portion of this Education Code, the Constitution or other Ordinances of the Kiowa Tribe, or of any law of the State of Oklahoma, or the laws of the United States, such reference applies to all amendments and additions now or hereafter made. 5. Title, division, part, chapter, article, and section headings do not in any manner affect the scope, meaning, or intent of the provisions of this Education Code. 6. If any provision of this Education Code, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the remainder of the Education Code, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby. 7. Whenever a power is granted to, or a duty is imposed upon, an officer of the Tribal Education Agency, the power may be exercised or the duty may be performed by a deputy of the officer or by a person authorized, pursuant to Tribal law, by the officer, unless this Education Code expressly provides otherwise. 8. Words giving a joint authority to three or more Tribal or public officers or other persons are construed as giving such authority to the majority of them, unless it is otherwise expressed in the provisions of the Education Code giving the authority. 9. Unless the provisions or the context otherwise requires, these general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions shall govern the construction of this Education Code.", "num": "KL-CY-2022-013", "path": "library|us/nsn/kiowa/council/resolutions|2022|Kiowa Tribe Res.

Deadly physical force is justified only when a reasonable person would believe it immediately necessary to protect himself or an innocent third person against the other's use or attempted use of unlawful deadly physical force. D. The use of physical force against another is not justified in response to verbal provocation alone, or to resist an arrest, whether lawful or unlawful, unless the physical force used by the arresting officer exceeds that allowed by law. 3.3.2 DURESS.

This defense is unavailable if such person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly places himself in a situation in which duress was foreseeable and for offenses involving homicide or the infliction of serious physical injury. 3.3.3 IMMATURITY.

H. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, a case may not be referred to a peacemaker more than one (1) time by the district court unless all of the parties in the case consent. Section 12..

Findings The Legislature hereby finds and declares that: (a) The Kiowa Tribe (\"Tribe\") provides jobs to hundreds of employees in the Tribe's government, gaming operations, gaming commission, and elsewhere. (b) Qualified employees receive benefits as part of their employment with the Tribe including retirement, health insurance, and dental and eye care benefits. (c) The Tribe's employee \"pool\" of hundreds of individuals, including employees of the Kiowa Casino Operating Authority (\"KCOA\"), allows the Tribe to offer better benefits at a lower cost per employee than might otherwise be available. (d) In June 2017, the Chairman of the Tribe or an individual who serves under the authority of the Chairman terminated the existing employee benefits provider (\"Existing Benefits Provider\") and the Tribe and KCOA are now utilizing a new, replacement benefits provider (\"New Benefits Provider\").

(e) Nothing in this Act is intended to select or otherwise direct the Chairman to select any particular company or entity to provide employee benefits. This Act is not a private law.

Rhonda J. Ahhaitty, Secretary of the Kiowa Tribe Legislature Section 1.1. Short Title This enactment shall be known as the \"Kiowa Housing Authority Reform Act 2017\" (\"Act\"). Section 1.2. Definitions (a) \"Chairman\" shall mean the Chairman of the Kiowa Tribe. (b) \"Constitution\" means the Constitution approved by the voters of the Tribe and the BIA on May 5, 2017. (c) \"DARKO\" means Darko Affordable Housing Solutions, LLC. (d) \"HUD\" means the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. (e) \"Kiowa Housing Authority\" means the entity which operates out of the Housing Authority offices at 1701 East Central Boulevard, Anadarko, Oklahoma, 73005, and serves as a sub-recipient of certain HUD federal funds authorized by the Tribe and provided to DARKO as Tribe's Tribally-Designated Housing Entity, and which otherwise operates and manages, in whole or in part, the Tribe's housing programs and services, or any other housing programs or services. (f) \"Legislature\" means the Legislature of the Kiowa Tribe. (g) \"TDHE\" means the tribally-designated housing entity. (h) \"Tribe\" means the Kiowa Tribe. Section 1.3. Purpose The purpose of this Act is to reform the Tribe's Housing Authority to bring it into compliance with the Constitution and laws of the Tribe, to take full responsibility to assert the Tribe's sovereign authority to address the housing needs of Members of the Tribe, and to abolish the outdated method of subjecting the Tribe's sovereign status to the full or partial control of the State of Oklahoma by operating the Tribe's Housing Authority, in whole or in part, as a State Agency. The purpose of the Act is also to re- establish respect for the Tribe's government, the institutions of government, and the Constitution and laws including the duty of the Tribe and its elected officials, as the People's representatives, to oversee and direct the establishment of a Department of Housing and the delivery of housing-related services. Section 1.4. Findings (a) In 1965, Oklahoma law established housing authorities for Indian tribes located within Oklahoma as State Agencies for the purpose of receiving federal housing funds (\"State Agency Housing Authority\") at a time when Indian tribes were not eligible to receive direct federal funding for housing programs. (b) After federal law changed, tribes in Oklahoma, including the Kiowa Tribe, have applied for and have received federal HUD funds directly from the federal government without the need to administer such funds through Oklahoma's State Agency Housing Authority. (c) The Tribe never addressed the confusion over the original State Agency Housing Authority called the Kiowa Housing Authority, and its assets and liabilities, and the Tribe's Housing Authority, which also operates and manages, either directly or as a sub-recipient, the Tribe's HUD funds and housing programs. (d) The Kiowa Housing Authority has been the subject of lengthy and expensive disputes, including litigation before the Oklahoma Supreme Court over the selection and authority of the Housing Authority Board of Commissioners. (e) The recent instability within the Tribe's government also contributed to the Tribe's and/or Kiowa Housing Authority's inability to properly manage and administer HUD funds, resulting in a sanction against the Tribe requiring the Tribe to repay HUD approximately seven million dollars ($7,000,000.00) in federal funds. (f) As a result of the improper management and administration of HUD funds, the Kiowa Housing Authority no longer receives any direct funding from HUD, rather, the Tribe has designated DARKO as a TDHE to receive the Tribe's HUD funds, and DARKO provides certain funds to the Kiowa Housing Authority as a sub-recipient. (g) The Kiowa Housing Authority has few, if any, State Agency Housing Authority assets or liabilities, as the Kiowa Housing Authority programmatic activities and services derive from its status as a sub-recipient of HUD funds. (h) The Tribe is not an irrelevant party in the provision of housing services to the Members of the Tribe, and in fact, the Tribe, and the Tribe's housing policies and laws are central to the provision of housing services to the Members of the Tribe, especially the Tribe's decision to request and receive HUD funding and to designate DARKO as the a TDHE. Section 1.5. No Effect on Existing Contract (a) Nothing in this Act is intended to alter or amend any existing contract with DARKO. (b) DARKO, as the Tribe's TDHE, shall provide the Chairman and Legislature with a written report on October 1st and April 1st of each year detailing to the status of the Tribe's HUD funds, all program and administrative expenditures including all fees and payments made to DARKO, and an overall assessment of the Tribe's housing programs and affairs. Section 1.6. Establishment of the Department of Housing (a) The Department of Housing is hereby established and shall be located with the Executive branch of government in accordance with Article VII, Section 1(c) of the Constitution . The Department of Housing shall include all housing programs, services, and housing entities of the Tribe including the Kiowa Housing Authority. The Kiowa Housing Authority shall be known as the Department of Housing and shall no longer be autonomous or semi-autonomous from the Tribe. (b) The Legislature hereby directs the Chairman to take any and all actions necessary to undertake, manage, and control the Kiowa Housing Authority, and to continue to provide housing programs for the benefit of the Members of the Tribe. (c) The Department of Housing shall operate and manage any and all Housing and Housing-related programs of the Tribe in compliance with the Constitution , laws, and budgets of the Tribe, and in compliance with all legal requirements that may be imposed as a condition of receiving HUD funds or any other funds. (d) The Department of Housing shall take all steps necessary to prepare the Tribe and the Department to apply for and receive HUD funds and other funds directly from the funding sources upon the expiration of the current contract with DARKO so that DARKO will no longer be needed as the Tribe's tribally-designated housing entity; provided, that the Department of Housing may continue to contract with DARKO to provide limited and short-term consulting services as needed and as authorized by the Housing Commission. Section 1.7. Establishment of Housing Commission (a) The Housing Commission is hereby established and shall be located within the Executive branch of government in accordance with Article VI, Section 6(h) of the Constitution . The Housing Commission shall consist of five members selected upon nomination by the Chairman and confirmation by the Legislature. (b) The Housing Commission shall have the authority to oversee and regulate the Department of Housing including establishing standards and procedures to operate the Department, and authorizing contracts for the Department including any local cooperative agreements for payments in lieu of taxes as authorized by HUD. The Housing Commission shall have the authority to select or terminate a Director of the Department of Housing, subject to approval of the Chairman; provided that, if the Chairman takes no action to approve the decision of the Housing Commission regarding a Director, then the decision of the Housing Commission shall be deemed approved. The Housing Commission shall have the authority to promulgate regulations governing the operation of the Department of Housing. Section 1.8. Oklahoma Law Encourages Tribes to Manage Housing Programs (a) Oklahoma law states in pertinent part, \"In the interest of the sovereign power of federally recognized Indian tribes, economy of efforts, and the maintenance of cooperative relationships between the state and federally recognized Indian tribes, and in light of the above findings, the state hereby authorizes any federally recognized Indian tribe, band or nation for whose benefit a state agency housing authority was or may be created, to assume management and control of the state agency Indian housing authority and all its assets, as provided in this section .\" See , 63 OS 1057 (2010). (b) Oklahoma law establishes a process for tribes to fully assume all management, assets, liabilities, and control of any State Agency Housing Authority designated for an Indian tribe by enacting a Resolution or law to undertake the management and control of the State Agency Housing Authority in accordance with the requirements of such law; and, (2) filing the Resolution or law with the Oklahoma Secretary of State, Oklahoma Attorney General, and with the appropriate County Clerk. (c) The Kiowa Housing Authority has not received any direct funding from HUD for some time, and the Kiowa Housing Authority does not currently receive any direct funding from HUD, i.e., any federal funds that the Kiowa Housing Authority receives comes from its status as a sub-recipient of HUD funds provided to DARKO. (d) Nothing in this Act authorizes the Chairman or Department of Housing to request any additional lands to be taken into trust with the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs or to request any change in any tax status of any real property. (e) The Legislature hereby directs the Chairman to take any and all actions necessary to undertake, manage, and control the State Agency Housing Authority as may be required, including assuming both the assets and liabilities of the State Agency Housing Authority and the Kiowa Housing Authority, to continue to provide housing programs for the benefit of the Members of the Tribe. Section 1.9. Authorization of Appropriation of Funds The Legislature hereby authorizes an appropriation of funds to be included in the Annual Budget or Budget Modification for expenditure to implement this Act .", "num": "KL-CY-2017-011", "path": "library|us/nsn/kiowa/council/resolutions|2017|Kiowa Tribe Res.

If by reason of death, sickness, or other disability, a judge before whom an action has been tried is unable to perform the duties to be performed by the court under these rules after a verdict is returned or findings of fact and conclusions of law are filed, then any other judge regularly sitting in or assigned to the court may perform those duties; but if such other judge is satisfied that he cannot perform those duties because he did not preside at the trial or for any other reason, he may in his discretion grant a new trial. (b) Disqualification. Whenever a party to any action or proceedings, civil or criminal, or his attorney shall make and file an affidavit that the judge before whom such action or proceeding is to be tried or hear has a bias or prejudice, either against such party or his attorney or in favor of any opposite party to the suit, such judge shall proceed no further therein, except to call in another judge to hear and determine the matter. Every such affidavit shall state the facts and the reasons for the belief that such bias or prejudice exists and shall be filed as soon as practicable after the case has been assigned or such bias or prejudice is known.

Every temporary restraining order granted without notice shall be endorsed with the date and hour of issuance; and shall be filed forthwith in the clerk's office and entered of record; shall define the injury and state why it is irreparable and why the order was granted without notice; and shall expire by its terms within such time after entry, not to exceed 15 days, as the court fixes, unless within the time so fixed the order, for good cause shown, is extended for a like period or unless the party against whom the order is directed consents that it may be extended for a longer period. The reasons for the extension shall be entered of record. In case a temporary restraining order is granted without notice, the motion for a preliminary injunction shall be set down for hearing at the earliest possible time and takes precedence over all matters except older matters of the same character; and when the motion comes on for hearing the party who obtained the temporary restraining order shall proceed with the application for a preliminary injunction and, if he does not do so, the court shall dissolve the temporary restraining order. On 2 days notice to the party who obtained the temporary restraining order without notice or on such shorter notice to that party as the court may prescribe, the adverse party may appear and move its dissolution or modification and in that event the court shall proceed to hear and determine such motion as expeditiously as the ends of justice require. (c) Security. Except as otherwise provided by law, no restraining order or preliminary injunction shall issue except upon the giving of security by the applicant, in such sum as the court deems proper, for the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained. No such security shall be required of the United States, the Kiowa Tribe, or of an officer, or agency, of either acting in an official capacity; nor shall it be required of a married person in a suit against the other party to the marriage contract.

(e) Grounds for Injunction. An injunction may be granted: (1) When it appears by the pleadings on file that a party is entitled to the relief demanded, and such relief, or any part thereof, consists in restraining the commission or continuance of some act complained of, either for a limited period or perpetually. (2) When it appears from the pleadings or by affidavit that the commission or continuance of some act during the litigation would produce great or irreparable injury to the party seeking injunctive relief. (3) When it appears during the litigation that either party is doing or threatens, or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act of violation of the rights of another party respecting the subject matter of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual. (4) In all other cases where an injunction would be proper in equity. Rule Rule 35 EXTRAORDINARY WRITS. (a) Grounds for Relief. Where no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy exists, relief may be obtained by obtaining an extraordinary writ that may be granted for any one of the following grounds: (1) Where any person usurps, intrudes into, or unlawfully holds or exercises a public office or does or permits to be done any act which by law works a forfeiture of his office; or (2) Where an inferior tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial functions has exceeded its jurisdiction or abused its discretion; or (3) Where the relief sought is to compel any inferior tribunal, board or person to perform an act which the law specially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station; or to compel the admission of a party to the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which he is entitled and from which he is excluded by such inferior tribunal, board or person; or (4) Where the relief sought is to arrest the proceedings of any tribunal, board or person, whether exercising functions judicial or ministerial, when such proceedings are without or in excess of the jurisdiction of such tribunal, board, or person. (b) Habeas Corpus.

If the writ is not issued, the court shall state its reasons in writing and file the same with the complaint and shall deliver a copy thereof to the plaintiff. If the defendant cannot be found, or if he does not have such person in custody, the writ (and any other process issued) may be served upon any one having such person in custody, in the manner and with the same effect as if he had been made defendant. in the action. The defendant shall appear at the proper time and place with the person designated or show good cause for not doing so and must answer the complaint within the time allowed. The answer must state plainly and unequivocally whether he then has, or at any time has had the person designated under this control and restraint, and if so, the cause thereof. If such person has been transferred, the defendant must state that fact, and to whom, when the transfer was made, and the reason or authority therefor. The writ shall not be disobeyed for any defect of form or mis-description of the person restrained or the defendant, if enough is stated to show the meaning and intent thereof. The person restrained may waive his right to be present at the hearing, in which case the writ shall be modified accordingly. Pending a determination of the matter the court may place such person in the custody of such individual or individuals as may be deemed proper. (c) Habeas Corpus; Decision. In each case, the court, upon determining the case, shall enter specific findings of fact and conclusions of law and judgment, in writing, and the same shall be made a part of the record in the case. If the court finds in favor of the complainant, it shall enter an appropriate order with respect to judgment or sentence in the former proceedings and such further orders with respect to re- arraignment, retrial, custody, bail, or discharge as the court may deem just and proper in the case. (d) Habeas Corpus Availability. Except in cases of extraordinary injustice, habeas corpus relief shall not be available to a person incarcerated as a result of a criminal conviction where the alleged grounds for relief have been or could have been raised by an appeal following the conviction. Rule 36 EXECUTION. (a) Time. If within 60 days after entry of a judgment awarding money damages and/or costs against a party, or within 60 days after final resolution of an appeal to the Supreme Court from such a judgment, it is made to appear to the court that the judgment debtor has not paid the judgment amount in full or commenced making installment payments in a manner agreed to by the parties, or is not current in such payments, the Court shall upon motion of the judgment creditor heard ex parte, order the Kiowa Tribal Police to execute on the personal property of the judgment debtor as provided herein. (b) Procedure. The court shall order the judgment debtor to appear before it and answer under oath regarding all his personal property. The court shall then determine what property of the judgment debtor is available for execution and order the Kiowa Tribal Police to seize as much of such property as reasonably appears necessary to pay the judgment amount. Failure of the judgment debtor to appear may be deemed a contempt of court and the court may proceed without such appearance. Sale of the seized property shall be at public auction conducted by the Kiowa Tribal Police after giving at least 10 days public notice posted in at least three conspicuous places within the Territory of the Tribe. Property shall be sold to the highest bidder who shall make payment for the property at the time of sale. The person conducting the auction may postpone such in his discretion if there is inadequate response to the action or the bidding and may reschedule such upon giving the required notice. (c) Exemption from Execution. The Court shall only order seizure and sale of such property of the judgment debtor to satisfy a money judgment the loss of which will not impose an immediate substantial hardship on the immediate family of the judgment debtor. Only property of the judgment debtor himself may be subject to execution and not property of his family. (d) Redemption from Sale. At any time within 6 months after sale under this Rule , the judgment debtor may redeem his property from the purchases thereof by paying the amount such purchaser paid for the property plus 8 percent interest, plus any expense actually incurred by the purchaser, such as taxes and insurance, to maintain the property. Rule 37 APPEAL. (a) Supreme Court. All appeals from the Kiowa Trial Court shall be heard by the Kiowa Supreme Court. (b) Right to Appeal. Any party who is aggrieved by any final order, commitment or judgment of the trial court may appeal in the manner prescribed by this Rule . (c) Time; Notice of Appeal. Within 20 days from the entry of the order of judgment appealed from the party taking the appeal must file with the trial court a written notice of appeal specifying the parties to the appeal, the order or judgment appealed from, and a short statement of the reason or grounds for the appeal. The clerk shall file the notice and mail copies, to be provided by the appealing party, to all other parties to the appeal at their last known address. (d) Parties. The party taking the appeal shall be referred to as the appellant; all other parties shall be referred to as the respondent. The name of the case shall be the same as that used in the trial court. (e) Bond on Appeal. At the time of filing the Notice of Appeal, the appellant shall also file cash or a surety bond in an amount set by the trial court sufficient to guarantee performance of the judgment if such performance is stayed on appeal plus, in any event, sufficient to guarantee payment of such costs or interest as the Supreme Court may award. (f) Stay Pending Appeal. In any case in which an appeal is perfected as required by this Rule , the appellant may petition the trial court for an order staying the order, commitment or judgment rendered conditioned upon execution of a bond to guarantee performance of the judgment, order or commitment. A stay shall begranted in all cases in which it is requested unless manifest injustice would result therefrom. (g) Clerk. The Clerk of the Trial Court shall also serve as the Clerk of the Supreme Court. Within 5 days after a Notice or Appeal is filed, the Clerk shall prepare, certify and file with the Supreme Court all papers comprising the record of the case appealed. A separate docket shall be maintained for the Supreme Court in which shall be recorded each stage of the proceedings on each case appealed. (h) Subpoenas. The presiding judge of the Supreme Court shall, when hearing a case, have authority by subpoena to compel a witness to attend and testify or compel the production of documents where such is deemed necessary to the rendition of the court's opinion. There shall not, however, be a new trial in the appellate court, and, except in cases where the findings of fact of the trial court are clearly erroneous, there will be no review of the factual findings of the trial court. (i) Briefs and Memoranda. Within 30 days of the filing of the Notice of Appeal or within such longer time as the Supreme Court shall allow, the appellant shall file a written brief, memorandum, or statement in support of his appeal. An original and two copies shall be filed with the clerk and one additional copy shall be served upon or mailed to each other party or his attorney. The respondent shall have 20 days after receipt of the appellant's brief, memorandum or statement and shall file and serve such in the same manner as the appellant's brief, memorandum, or statement. No further response shall be allowed either party without leave of court. (j) Argument. The Supreme Court shall decide all cases upon the briefs, memoranda and statements filed plus the record of the trial court without oral argument unless either party requests oral argument and shows to the court that such will be likely to aid the court's decision, or unless the court decides on its own motion to hear oral argument. (k) Decision. The Supreme Court shall issue a written decision and all judgments on appeal which shall be final unless federal law or regulations provide for further extra- Tribal remedies. Rule 38 CITATION. These Rules shall be known as the Kiowa Rules of Civil Procedure and may be abbreviated K.R.C.P. Rule 39 FEES. The Chief Judge of the Trial Court, under recommendation of the Clerk of the Court, shall, from time to time, set a schedule of fees. Under no circumstances may the fee for an Order of Protection be more than ten dollars ($10). Thirty days prior to the fee schedule going into effect, the Chief Judge shall give notice to the Tribal Legislature and Council that a new schedule is going into effect and provide a copy of the schedule. Rule 40 USE AND APPLICATION OF FEDERAL AND STATE RULES. To the extent that it is found that certain necessary court procedures and laws have not been adequately addressed in the Kiowa Tribal District Court Rules, the Kiowa Tribal Code of Civil Procedure or by the Kiowa Tribal Law &amp; Order Code, the Kiowa Judiciary may draw upon the Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure, as well as the Local Court Rules of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma for guidance and application as in the discretion of the Kiowa Judiciary will best serve the efficient and timely dispensing of justice. Only upon a finding that a such void in the Kiowa Codes and Rules is not adequately addressed by the federal rules, may the Kiowa Judiciary then look to employ the Oklahoma Criminal, Civil and Appellate Procedures.", "num": "KL-CY-2017-008", "path": "library|us/nsn/kiowa/council/resolutions|2017|Kiowa Tribe Res.

Rhonda J. Ahhaitty, Secretary of the Kiowa Tribe Legislature ABA MODEL CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT FEBRUARY 2007 None (1) An independent, fair and impartial judiciary is indispensable to our system of justice. The United States legal system is based upon the principle that an independent, impartial, and competent judiciary, composed of men and women of integrity, will interpret and apply the law that governs our society. Thus, the judiciary plays a central role in preserving the principles of justice and the rule of law. Inherent in all the Rules contained in this Code are the precepts that judges, individually and collectively, must respect and honor the judicial office as a public trust and strive to maintain and enhance confidence in the legal system. (2) Judges should maintain the dignity of judicial office at all times, and avoid both impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in their professional and personal lives. They should aspire at all times to conduct that ensures the greatest possible public confidence in their independence, impartiality, integrity, and competence. (3) The Model Code of Judicial Conduct establishes standards for the ethical conduct of judges and judicial candidates. It is not intended as an exhaustive guide for the conduct of judges and judicial candidates, who are governed in their judicial and personal conduct by general ethical standards as well as by the Code. The Code is intended, however, to provide guidance and assist judges in maintaining the highest standards of judicial and personal conduct, and to provide a basis for regulating their conduct through disciplinary agencies. None (1) The Model Code of Judicial Conduct consists of four Canons, numbered Rules under each Canon, and Comments that generally follow and explain each Rule. Scope and Terminology sections provide additional guidance in interpreting and applying the Code. An Application section establishes when the various Rules apply to a judge or judicial candidate. (2) The Canons state overarching principles of judicial ethics that all judges must observe. Although a judge may be disciplined only for violating a Rule, the Canons provide important guidance in interpreting the Rules. Where a Rule contains a permissive term, such as \"may\" or \"should,\" the conduct being addressed is committed to the personal and professional discretion of the judge or candidate in question, and no disciplinary action should be taken for action or inaction within the bounds of such discretion. (3) The Comments that accompany the Rules serve two functions. First, they provide guidance regarding the purpose, meaning, and proper application of the Rules. They contain explanatory material and, in some instances, provide examples of permitted or prohibited conduct. Comments neither add to nor subtract from the binding obligations set forth in the Rules. Therefore, when a Comment contains the term \"must,\" it does not mean that the Comment itself is binding or enforceable; it signifies that the Rule in question, properly understood, is obligatory as to the conduct at issue. (4) Second, the Comments identify aspirational goals for judges. To implement fully the principles of this Code as articulated in the Canons, judges should strive to exceed the standards of conduct established by the Rules, holding themselves to the highest ethical standards and seeking to achieve those aspirational goals, thereby enhancing the dignity of the judicial office. (5) The Rules of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct are rules of reason that should be applied consistent with constitutional requirements, statutes, other court rules, and decisional law, and with due regard for all relevant circumstances. The Rules should not be interpreted to impinge upon the essential independence of judges in making judicial decisions. (6) Although the black letter of the Rules is binding and enforceable, it is not contemplated that every transgression will result in the imposition of discipline. Whether discipline should be imposed should be determined through a reasonable and reasoned application of the Rules, and should depend upon factors such as the seriousness of the transgression, the facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the transgression, the extent of any pattern of improper activity, whether there have been previous violations, and the effect of the improper activity upon the judicial system or others. (7) The Code is not designed or intended as a basis for civil or criminal liability. Neither is it intended to be the basis for litigants to seek collateral remedies against each other or to obtain tactical advantages in proceedings before a court. None The first time any term listed below is used in a Rule in its defined sense, it is followed by an asterisk (*). \"Aggregate,\" in relation to contributions for a candidate, means not only contributions in cash or in kind made directly to a candidate's campaign committee, but also all contributions made indirectly with the understanding that they will be used to support the election of a candidate or to oppose the election of the candidate's opponent. See Rules 2.11 and 4.4. \"Appropriate authority\" means the authority having responsibility for initiation of disciplinary process in connection with the violation to be reported. See Rules 2.14 and 2.15. \"Contribution\" means both financial and in-kind contributions, such as goods, professional or volunteer services, advertising, and other types of assistance, which, if obtained by the recipient otherwise, would require a financial expenditure. See Rules 2.11, 2.13, 3.7, 4.1, and 4.4. \"De minimis,\" in the context of interests pertaining to disqualification of a judge, means an insignificant interest that could not raise a reasonable question regarding the judge's impartiality. See Rule 2.11. \"Domestic partner\" means a person with whom another person maintains a household and an intimate relationship, other than a person to whom he or she is legally married. See Rules 2.11, 2.13, 3.13, and 3.14. \"Economic interest\" means ownership of more than a de minimis legal or equitable interest. Except for situations in which the judge participates in the management of such a legal or equitable interest, or the interest could be substantially affected by the outcome of a proceeding before a judge, it does not include: (1) an interest in the individual holdings within a mutual or common investment fund; (2) an interest in securities held by an educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic organization in which the judge or the judge's spouse, domestic partner, parent, or child serves as a director, an officer, an advisor, or other participant; (3) a deposit in a financial institution or deposits or proprietary interests the judge may maintain as a member of a mutual savings association or credit union, or similar proprietary interests; or (4) an interest in the issuer of government securities held by the judge. See Rules 1.3 and 2.11. \"Fiduciary\" includes relationships such as executor, administrator, trustee, or guardian. See Rules 2.11, 3.2, and 3.8. \"Impartial,\" \"impartiality,\" and \"impartially\" mean absence of bias or prejudice in favor of, or against, particular parties or classes of parties, as well as maintenance of an open mind in considering issues that may come before a judge. See Canons 1, 2, and 4, and Rules 1.2, 2.2, 2.10, 2.11, 2.13, 3.1, 3.12, 3.13, 4.1, and 4.2. \"Impending matter\" is a matter that is imminent or expected to occur in the near future. See Rules 2.9, 2.10, 3.13, and 4.1. \"Impropriety\" includes conduct that violates the law, court rules, or provisions of this Code, and conduct that undermines a judge's independence, integrity, or impartiality. See Canon 1 and Rule 1.2. \"Independence\" means a judge's freedom from influence or controls other than those established by law. See Canons 1 and 4, and Rules 1.2, 3.1, 3.12, 3.13, and 4.2. \"Integrity\" means probity, fairness, honesty, uprightness, and soundness of character. See Canon 1 and Rule 1.2. \"Judicial candidate\" means any person, including a sitting judge, who is seeking selection for or retention in judicial office by election or appointment. A person becomes a candidate for judicial office as soon as he or she makes a public announcement of candidacy, declares or files as a candidate with the election or appointment authority, authorizes or, where permitted, engages in solicitation or acceptance of contributions or support, or is nominated for election or appointment to office. See Rules 2.11, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.4. \"Knowingly,\" \"knowledge,\" \"known,\" and \"knows\" mean actual knowledge of the fact in question. A person's knowledge may be inferred from circumstances. See Rules 2.11, 2.13, 2.15, 2.16, 3.6, and 4.1. \"Law\" encompasses court rules as well as statutes, constitutional provisions, and decisional law. See Rules 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.6, 2.7, 2.9, 3.1, 3.4, 3.9, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, and 4.5. \"Member of the candidate's family\" means a spouse, domestic partner, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, or other relative or person with whom the candidate maintains a close familial relationship. \"Member of the judge's family\" means a spouse, domestic partner, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, or other relative or person with whom the judge maintains a close familial relationship. See Rules 3.7, 3.8, 3.10, and 3.11. \"Member of a judge's family residing in the judge's household\" means any relative of a judge by blood or marriage, or a person treated by a judge as a member of the judge's family, who resides in the judge's household. See Rules 2.11 and 3.13. \"Nonpublic information\" means information that is not available to the public. Nonpublic information may include, but is not limited to, information that is sealed by statute or court order or impounded or communicated in camera, and information offered in grand jury proceedings, presentencing reports, dependency cases, or psychiatric reports. See Rule 3.5. \"Pending matter\" is a matter that has commenced. A matter continues to be pending through any appellate process until final disposition. See Rules 2.9, 2.10, 3.13, and 4.1. \"Personally solicit\" means a direct request made by a judge or a judicial candidate for financial support or in-kind services, whether made by letter, telephone, or any other means of communication. See Rule 4.1. \"Political organization\" means a political party or other group sponsored by or affiliated with a political party or candidate, the principal purpose of which is to further the election or appointment of candidates for political office. For purposes of this Code, the term does not include a judicial candidate's campaign committee created as authorized by Rule 4.4. See Rules 4.1 and 4.2. \"Public election\" includes primary and general elections, partisan elections, nonpartisan elections, and retention elections. See Rules 4.2 and 4.4. \"Third degree of relationship\" includes the following persons: great-grandparent, grandparent, parent, uncle, aunt, brother, sister, child, grandchild, great-grandchild, nephew, and niece. See Rule 2.11. None The Application section establishes when the various Rules apply to a judge or judicial candidate. I. APPLICABILITY OF THIS CODE (A) The provisions of the Code apply to all full-time judges. Parts II through V of this section identify those provisions that apply to four distinct categories of part-time judges. The four categories of judicial service in other than a full-time capacity are necessarily defined in general terms because of the widely varying forms of judicial service. Canon 4 applies to judicial candidates. (B) A judge, within the meaning of this Code, is anyone who is authorized to perform judicial functions, including an officer such as a justice of the peace, magistrate, court commissioner, special master, referee, or member of the administrative law judiciary. 1 COMMENT (1) The Rules in this Code have been formulated to address the ethical obligations of any person who serves a judicial function, and are premised upon the supposition that a uniform system of ethical principles should apply to all those authorized to perform judicial functions. (2) The determination of which category and, accordingly, which specific Rules apply to an individual judicial officer, depends upon the facts of the particular judicial service. (3) In recent years many jurisdictions have created what are often called \"problem solving\" courts, in which judges are authorized by court rules to act in nontraditional ways. For example, judges presiding in drug courts and monitoring the progress of participants in those courts' programs may be authorized and even encouraged to communicate directly with social workers, probation officers, and others outside the context of their usual judicial role as independent decision makers on issues of fact and law. When local rules specifically authorize conduct not otherwise permitted under these Rules, they take precedence over the provisions set forth in the Code. Nevertheless, judges serving on \"problem solving\" courts shall comply with this Code except to the extent local rules provide and permit otherwise. II. RETIRED JUDGE SUBJECT TO RECALL A retired judge subject to recall for service, who by law is not permitted to practice law, is not required to comply: (A) with Rule 3.9 (Service as Arbitrator or Mediator), except while serving as a judge; or (B) at any time with Rule 3.8 (Appointments to Fiduciary Positions). COMMENT (1) For the purposes of this section, as long as a retired judge is subject to being recalled for service, the judge is considered to \"perform judicial functions.\" III. CONTINUING PART-TIME JUDGE A judge who serves repeatedly on a part-time basis by election or under a continuing appointment, including a retired judge subject to recall who is permitted to practice law (\"continuing part-time judge\"), (A) is not required to comply: (1) with Rules 2.10(A) and 2.10(B) (Judicial Statements on Pending and Impending Cases), except while serving as a judge; or (2) at any time with Rules 3.4 (Appointments to Governmental Positions), 3.8 (Appointments to Fiduciary Positions), 3.9 (Service as Arbitrator or Mediator), 3.10 (Practice of Law), 3.11 (Financial, Business, or Remunerative Activities), 3.14 (Reimbursement of Expenses and Waivers of Fees or Charges), 3.15 (Reporting Requirements), 4.1 (Political and Campaign Activities of Judges and Judicial Candidates in General), 4.2 (Political and Campaign Activities of Judicial Candidates in Public Elections), 4.3 (Activities of Candidates for Appointive Judicial Office), 4.4 (Campaign Committees), and 4.5 (Activities of Judges Who Become Candidates for Nonjudicial Office); and (B) shall not practice law in the court on which the judge serves or in any court subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the court on which the judge serves, and shall not act as a lawyer in a proceeding in which the judge has served as a judge or in any other proceeding related thereto. COMMENT (1) When a person who has been a continuing part-time judge is no longer a continuing part-time judge, including a retired judge no longer subject to recall, that person may act as a lawyer in a proceeding in which he or she has served as a judge or in any other proceeding related thereto only with the informed consent of all parties, and pursuant to any applicable Model Rules of Professional Conduct. An adopting jurisdiction should substitute a reference to its applicable rule. IV. PERIODIC PART-TIME JUDGE A periodic part-time judge who serves or expects to serve repeatedly on a part-time basis, but under a separate appointment for each limited period of service or for each matter, (A) is not required to comply: (1) with Rule 2.10 (Judicial Statements on Pending and Impending Cases), except while serving as a judge; or (2) at any time with Rules 3.4 (Appointments to Governmental Positions), 3.7 (Participation in Educational, Religious, Charitable, Fraternal, or Civic Organizations and Activities), 3.8 (Appointments to Fiduciary Positions), 3.9 (Service as Arbitrator or Mediator), 3.10 (Practice of Law), 3.11 (Financial, Business, or Remunerative Activities), 3.13 (Acceptance and Reporting of Gifts, Loans, Bequests, Benefits, or Other Things of Value), 3.15 (Reporting Requirements), 4.1 (Political and Campaign Activities of Judges and Judicial Candidates in General), and 4.5 (Activities of Judges Who Become Candidates for Nonjudicial Office); and (B) shall not practice law in the court on which the judge serves or in any court subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the court on which the judge serves, and shall not act as a lawyer in a proceeding in which the judge has served as a judge or in any other proceeding related thereto. V. PRO TEMPORE PART-TIME JUDGE A pro tempore part-time judge who serves or expects to serve once or only sporadically on a part-time basis under a separate appointment for each period of service or for each case heard is not required to comply: (A) except while serving as a judge, with Rules 1.2 (Promoting Confidence in the Judiciary), 2.4 (External Influences on Judicial Conduct), 2.10 (Judicial Statements on Pending and Impending Cases), or 3.2 (Appearances before Governmental Bodies and Consultation with Government Officials); or (B) at any time with Rules 3.4 (Appointments to Governmental Positions), 3.6 (Affiliation with Discriminatory Organizations), 3.7 (Participation in Educational, Religious, Charitable, Fraternal, or Civic Organizations and Activities), 3.8 (Appointments to Fiduciary Positions), 3.9 (Service as Arbitrator or Mediator), 3.10 (Practice of Law), 3.11 (Financial, Business, or Remunerative Activities), 3.13 (Acceptance and Reporting of Gifts, Loans, Bequests, Benefits, or Other Things of Value), 3.15 (Reporting Requirements), 4.1 (Political and Campaign Activities of Judges and Judicial Candidates in General), and 4.5 (Activities of Judges Who Become Candidates for Nonjudicial Office). VI. TIME FOR COMPLIANCE A person to whom this Code becomes applicable shall comply immediately with its provisions, except that those judges to whom Rules 3.8 (Appointments to Fiduciary Positions) and 3.11 (Financial, Business, or Remunerative Activities) apply shall comply with those Rules as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than one year after the Code becomes applicable to the judge. COMMENT (1) If serving as a fiduciary when selected as judge, a new judge may, notwithstanding the prohibitions in Rule 3.8, continue to serve as fiduciary, but only for that period of time necessary to avoid serious adverse consequences to the beneficiaries of the fiduciary relationship and in no event longer than one year. Similarly, if engaged at the time of judicial selection in a business activity, a new judge may, notwithstanding the prohibitions in Rule 3.11, continue in that activity for a reasonable period but in no event longer than one year. CANON 1 A JUDGE SHALL UPHOLD AND PROMOTE THE INDEPENDENCE, INTEGRITY, AND IMPARTIALITY OF THE JUDICIARY, AND SHALL AVOID IMPROPRIETY AND THE APPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY. RULE 1.1 Compliance with the Law A judge shall comply with the law,* including the Code of Judicial Conduct. RULE 1.2 Promoting Confidence in the Judiciary A judge shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence,* integrity,* and impartiality* of the judiciary, and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety. COMMENT (1) Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by improper conduct and conduct that creates the appearance of impropriety. This principle applies to both the professional and personal conduct of a judge. (2) A judge should expect to be the subject of public scrutiny that might be viewed as burdensome if applied to other citizens, and must accept the restrictions imposed by the Code. (3) Conduct that compromises or appears to compromise the independence, integrity, and impartiality of a judge undermines public confidence in the judiciary. Because it is not practicable to list all such conduct, the Rule is necessarily cast in general terms. (4) Judges should participate in activities that promote ethical conduct among judges and lawyers, support professionalism within the judiciary and the legal profession, and promote access to justice for all. (5) Actual improprieties include violations of law, court rules or provisions of this Code. The test for appearance of impropriety is whether the conduct would create in reasonable minds a perception that the judge violated this Code or engaged in other conduct that reflects adversely on the judge's honesty, impartiality, temperament, or fitness to serve as a judge. (6) A judge should initiate and participate in community outreach activities for the purpose of promoting public understanding of and confidence in the administration of justice. In conducting such activities, the judge must act in a manner consistent with this Code. RULE 1.3 Avoiding Abuse of the Prestige of Judicial Office A judge shall not abuse the prestige of judicial office to advance the personal or economic interests* of the judge or others, or allow others to do so. COMMENT (1) It is improper for a judge to use or attempt to use his or her position to gain personal advantage or deferential treatment of any kind. For example, it would be improper for a judge to allude to his or her judicial status to gain favorable treatment in encounters with traffic officials. Similarly, a judge must not use judicial letterhead to gain an advantage in conducting his or her personal business. (2) A judge may provide a reference or recommendation for an individual based upon the judge's personal knowledge. The judge may use official letterhead if the judge indicates that the reference is personal and if there is no likelihood that the use of the letterhead would reasonably be perceived as an attempt to exert pressure by reason of the judicial office. (3) Judges may participate in the process of judicial selection by cooperating with appointing authorities and screening committees, and by responding to inquiries from such entities concerning the professional qualifications of a person being considered for judicial office. (4) Special considerations arise when judges write or contribute to publications of for-profit entities, whether related or unrelated to the law. A judge should not permit anyone associated with the publication of such materials to exploit the judge's office in a manner that violates this Rule or other applicable law. In contracts for publication of a judge's writing, the judge should retain sufficient control over the advertising to avoid such exploitation. CANON 2 A JUDGE SHALL PERFORM THE DUTIES OF JUDICIAL OFFICE IMPARTIALLY, COMPETENTLY, AND DILIGENTLY. RULE 2.1 Giving Precedence to the Duties of Judicial Office The duties of judicial office, as prescribed by law,* shall take precedence over all of a judge's personal and extrajudicial activities. COMMENT (1) To ensure that judges are available to fulfill their judicial duties, judges must conduct their personal and extrajudicial activities to minimize the risk of conflicts that would result in frequent disqualification. See Canon 3. (2) Although it is not a duty of judicial office unless prescribed by law, judges are encouraged to participate in activities that promote public understanding of and confidence in the justice system. RULE 2.2 Impartiality and Fairness A judge shall uphold and apply the law,* and shall perform all duties of judicial office fairly and impartially.* COMMENT (1) To ensure impartiality and fairness to all parties, a judge must be objective and open-minded. (2) Although each judge comes to the bench with a unique background and personal philosophy, a judge must interpret and apply the law without regard to whether the judge approves or disapproves of the law in question. (3) When applying and interpreting the law, a judge sometimes may make good-faith errors of fact or law. Errors of this kind do not violate this Rule. (4) It is not a violation of this Rule for a judge to make reasonable accommodations to ensure pro se litigants the opportunity to have their matters fairly heard. RULE 2.3 Bias, Prejudice, and Harassment (A) A judge shall perform the duties of judicial office, including administrative duties, without bias or prejudice. (B) A judge shall not, in the performance of judicial duties, by words or conduct manifest bias or prejudice, or engage in harassment, including but not limited to bias, prejudice, or harassment based upon race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, socioeconomic status, or political affiliation, and shall not permit court staff, court officials, or others subject to the judge's direction and control to do so. (C) A judge shall require lawyers in proceedings before the court to refrain from manifesting bias or prejudice, or engaging in harassment, based upon attributes including but not limited to race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, socioeconomic status, or political affiliation, against parties, witnesses, lawyers, or others. (D) The restrictions of paragraphs (B) and (C) do not preclude judges or lawyers from making legitimate reference to the listed factors, or similar factors, when they are relevant to an issue in a proceeding. COMMENT (1) A judge who manifests bias or prejudice in a proceeding impairs the fairness of the proceeding and brings the judiciary into disrepute. (2) Examples of manifestations of bias or prejudice include but are not limited to epithets; slurs; demeaning nicknames; negative stereotyping; attempted humor based upon stereotypes; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; suggestions of connections between race, ethnicity, or nationality and crime; and irrelevant references to personal characteristics. Even facial expressions and body language can convey to parties and lawyers in the proceeding, jurors, the media, and others an appearance of bias or prejudice. A judge must avoid conduct that may reasonably be perceived as prejudiced or biased. (3) Harassment, as referred to in paragraphs (B) and (C), is verbal or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward a person on bases such as race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, socioeconomic status, or political affiliation. (4) Sexual harassment includes but is not limited to sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is unwelcome. RULE 2.4 External Influences on Judicial Conduct (A) A judge shall not be swayed by public clamor or fear of criticism. (B) A judge shall not permit family, social, political, financial, or other interests or relationships to influence the judge's judicial conduct or judgment. (C) A judge shall not convey or permit others to convey the impression that any person or organization is in a position to influence the judge. COMMENT (1) An independent judiciary requires that judges decide cases according to the law and facts, without regard to whether particular laws or litigants are popular or unpopular with the public, the media, government officials, or the judge's friends or family. Confidence in the judiciary is eroded if judicial decision making is perceived to be subject to inappropriate outside influences. RULE 2.5 Competence, Diligence, and Cooperation (A) A judge shall perform judicial and administrative duties, competently and diligently. (B) A judge shall cooperate with other judges and court officials in the administration of court business. COMMENT (1) Competence in the performance of judicial duties requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary to perform a judge's responsibilities of judicial office. (2) A judge should seek the necessary docket time, court staff, expertise, and resources to discharge all adjudicative and administrative responsibilities. (3) Prompt disposition of the court's business requires a judge to devote adequate time to judicial duties, to be punctual in attending court and expeditious in determining matters under submission, and to take reasonable measures to ensure that court officials, litigants, and their lawyers cooperate with the judge to that end. (4) In disposing of matters promptly and efficiently, a judge must demonstrate due regard for the rights of parties to be heard and to have issues resolved without unnecessary cost or delay. A judge should monitor and supervise cases in ways that reduce or eliminate dilatory practices, avoidable delays, and unnecessary costs. RULE 2.6 Ensuring the Right to Be Heard (A) A judge shall accord to every person who has a legal interest in a proceeding, or that person's lawyer, the right to be heard according to law.* (B) A judge may encourage parties to a proceeding and their lawyers to settle matters in dispute but shall not act in a manner that coerces any party into settlement. COMMENT (1) The right to be heard is an essential component of a fair and impartial system of justice. Substantive rights of litigants can be protected only if procedures protecting the right to be heard are observed. (2) The judge plays an important role in overseeing the settlement of disputes, but should be careful that efforts to further settlement do not undermine any party's right to be heard according to law. The judge should keep in mind the effect that the judge's participation in settlement discussions may have, not only on the judge's own views of the case, but also on the perceptions of the lawyers and the parties if the case remains with the judge after settlement efforts are unsuccessful. Among the factors that a judge should consider when deciding upon an appropriate settlement practice for a case are (1) whether the parties have requested or voluntarily consented to a certain level of participation by the judge in settlement discussions, (2) whether the parties and their counsel are relatively sophisticated in legal matters, (3) whether the case will be tried by the judge or a jury, (4) whether the parties participate with their counsel in settlement discussions, (5) whether any parties are unrepresented by counsel, and (6) whether the matter is civil or criminal. (3) Judges must be mindful of the effect settlement discussions can have, not only on their objectivity and impartiality, but also on the appearance of their objectivity and impartiality. Despite a judge's best efforts, there may be instances when information obtained during settlement discussions could influence a judge's decision making during trial, and, in such instances, the judge should consider whether disqualification may be appropriate. See Rule 2.11(A)(1). RULE 2.7 Responsibility to Decide A judge shall hear and decide matters assigned to the judge, except when disqualification is required by Rule 2.11 or other law.* COMMENT (1) Judges must be available to decide the matters that come before the court. Although there are times when disqualification is necessary to protect the rights of litigants and preserve public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, judges must be available to decide matters that come before the courts. Unwarranted disqualification may bring public disfavor to the court and to the judge personally. The dignity of the court, the judge's respect for fulfillment of judicial duties, and a proper concern for the burdens that may be imposed upon the judge's colleagues require that a judge not use disqualification to avoid cases that present difficult, controversial, or unpopular issues. RULE 2.8 Decorum, Demeanor, and Communication with Jurors (A) A judge shall require order and decorum in proceedings before the court. (B) A judge shall be patient, dignified, and courteous to litigants, jurors, witnesses, lawyers, court staff, court officials, and others with whom the judge deals in an official capacity, and shall require similar conduct of lawyers, court staff, court officials, and others subject to the judge's direction and control. (C) A judge shall not commend or criticize jurors for their verdict other than in a court order or opinion in a proceeding. COMMENT (1) The duty to hear all proceedings with patience and courtesy is not inconsistent with the duty imposed in Rule 2.5 to dispose promptly of the business of the court. Judges can be efficient and businesslike while being patient and deliberate. (2) Commending or criticizing jurors for their verdict may imply a judicial expectation in future cases and may impair a juror's ability to be fair and impartial in a subsequent case. (3) A judge who is not otherwise prohibited by law from doing so may meet with jurors who choose to remain after trial but should be careful not to discuss the merits of the case. RULE 2.9 Ex Parte Communications (A) A judge shall not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications, or consider other communications made to the judge outside the presence of the parties or their lawyers, concerning a pending* or impending matter,* except as follows: (1) When circumstances require it, ex parte communication for scheduling, administrative, or emergency purposes, which does not address substantive matters, is permitted, provided: (a) the judge reasonably believes that no party will gain a procedural, substantive, or tactical advantage as a result of the ex parte communication; and (b) the judge makes provision promptly to notify all other parties of the substance of the ex parte communication, and gives the parties an opportunity to respond. (2) A judge may obtain the written advice of a disinterested expert on the law applicable to a proceeding before the judge, if the judge gives advance notice to the parties of the person to be consulted and the subject matter of the advice to be solicited, and affords the parties a reasonable opportunity to object and respond to the notice and to the advice received. (3) A judge may consult with court staff and court officials whose functions are to aid the judge in carrying out the judge's adjudicative responsibilities, or with other judges, provided the judge makes reasonable efforts to avoid receiving factual information that is not part of the record, and does not abrogate the responsibility personally to decide the matter. (4) A judge may, with the consent of the parties, confer separately with the parties and their lawyers in an effort to settle matters pending before the judge. (5) A judge may initiate, permit, or consider any ex parte communication when expressly authorized by law to do so. (B) If a judge inadvertently receives an unauthorized ex parte communication bearing upon the substance of a matter, the judge shall make provision promptly to notify the parties of the substance of the communication and provide the parties with an opportunity to respond. (C) A judge shall not investigate facts in a matter independently, and shall consider only the evidence presented and any facts that may properly be judicially noticed. (D) A judge shall make reasonable efforts, including providing appropriate supervision, to ensure that this Rule is not violated by court staff, court officials, and others subject to the judge's direction and control. COMMENT (1) To the extent reasonably possible, all parties or their lawyers shall be included in communications with a judge. (2) Whenever the presence of a party or notice to a party is required by this Rule, it is the party's lawyer, or if the party is unrepresented, the party, who is to be present or to whom notice is to be given. (3) The proscription against communications concerning a proceeding includes communications with lawyers, law teachers, and other persons who are not participants in the proceeding, except to the limited extent permitted by this Rule. (4) A judge may initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications expressly authorized by law, such as when serving on therapeutic or problem-solving courts, mental health courts, or drug courts. In this capacity, judges may assume a more interactive role with parties, treatment providers, probation officers, social workers, and others. (5) A judge may consult with other judges on pending matters, but must avoid ex parte discussions of a case with judges who have previously been disqualified from hearing the matter, and with judges who have appellate jurisdiction over the matter. (6) The prohibition against a judge investigating the facts in a matter extends to information available in all mediums, including electronic. (7) A judge may consult ethics advisory committees, outside counsel, or legal experts concerning the judge's compliance with this Code. Such consultations are not subject to the restrictions of paragraph (A)(2). RULE 2.10 Judicial Statements on Pending and Impending Cases (A) A judge shall not make any public statement that might reasonably be expected to affect the outcome or impair the fairness of a matter pending* or impending in any court, or make any nonpublic statement that might substantially interfere with a fair trial or hearing. (B) A judge shall not, in connection with cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come before the court, make pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial* performance of the adjudicative duties of judicial office. (C) A judge shall require court staff, court officials, and others subject to the judge's direction and control to refrain from making statements that the judge would be prohibited from making by paragraphs (A) and (B). (D) Notwithstanding the restrictions in paragraph (A), a judge may make public statements in the course of official duties, may explain court procedures, and may comment on any proceeding in which the judge is a litigant in a personal capacity. (E) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (A), a judge may respond directly or through a third party to allegations in the media or elsewhere concerning the judge's conduct in a matter. COMMENT (1) This Rule's restrictions on judicial speech are essential to the maintenance of the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary. (2) This Rule does not prohibit a judge from commenting on proceedings in which the judge is a litigant in a personal capacity. In cases in which the judge is a litigant in an official capacity, such as a writ of mandamus, the judge must not comment publicly. (3) Depending upon the circumstances, the judge should consider whether it may be preferable for a third party, rather than the judge, to respond or issue statements in connection with allegations concerning the judge's conduct in a matter. RULE 2.11 Disqualification (A) A judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge's impartiality* might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to the following circumstances: (1) The judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or a party's lawyer, or personal knowledge* of facts that are in dispute in the proceeding. (2) The judge knows that the judge, the judge's spouse or domestic partner,* or a person within the third degree of relationship* to either of them, or the spouse or domestic partner of such a person is: (a) a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, general partner, managing member, or trustee of a party; (b) acting as a lawyer in the proceeding; (c) a person who has more than a de minimis* interest that could be substantially affected by the proceeding; or (d) likely to be a material witness in the proceeding. (3) The judge knows that he or she, individually or as a fiduciary,* or the judge's spouse, domestic partner, parent, or child, or any other member of the judge's family residing in the judge's household,* has an economic interest in the subject matter in controversy or is a party to the proceeding. (4) The judge knows or learns by means of a timely motion that a party, a party's lawyer, or the law firm of a party's lawyer has within the previous [insert number] year[s] made aggregate* contributions* to the judge's campaign in an amount that [is greater than $[insert amount] for an individual or $[insert amount] for an entity] [is reasonable and appropriate for an individual or an entity]. (5) The judge, while a judge or a judicial candidate,* has made a public statement, other than in a court proceeding, judicial decision, or opinion, that commits or appears to commit the judge to reach a particular result or rule in a particular way in the proceeding or controversy. (6) The judge: (a) served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy, or was associated with a lawyer who participated substantially as a lawyer in the matter during such association; (b) served in governmental employment, and in such capacity participated personally and substantially as a lawyer or public official concerning the proceeding, or has publicly expressed in such capacity an opinion concerning the merits of the particular matter in controversy; (c) was a material witness concerning the matter; or (d) previously presided as a judge over the matter in another court. (B) A judge shall keep informed about the judge's personal and fiduciary economic interests, and make a reasonable effort to keep informed about the personal economic interests of the judge's spouse or domestic partner and minor children residing in the judge's household. (C) A judge subject to disqualification under this Rule, other than for bias or prejudice under paragraph (A)(1), may disclose on the record the basis of the judge's disqualification and may ask the parties and their lawyers to consider, outside the presence of the judge and court personnel, whether to waive disqualification. If, following the disclosure, the parties and lawyers agree, without participation by the judge or court personnel, that the judge should not be disqualified, the judge may participate in the proceeding. The agreement shall be incorporated into the record of the proceeding. COMMENT (1) Under this Rule, a judge is disqualified whenever the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, regardless of whether any of the specific provisions of paragraphs (A)(1) through (6) apply. In many jurisdictions, the term \"recusal\" is used interchangeably with the term \"disqualification.\" (2) A judge's obligation not to hear or decide matters in which disqualification is required applies regardless of whether a motion to disqualify is filed. (3) The rule of necessity may override the rule of disqualification. For example, a judge might be required to participate in judicial review of a judicial salary statute, or might be the only judge available in a matter requiring immediate judicial action, such as a hearing on probable cause or a temporary restraining order. In matters that require immediate action, the judge must disclose on the record the basis for possible disqualification and make reasonable efforts to transfer the matter to another judge as soon as practicable. (4) The fact that a lawyer in a proceeding is affiliated with a law firm with which a relative of the judge is affiliated does not itself disqualify the judge. If, however, the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned under paragraph (A), or the relative is known by the judge to have an interest in the law firm that could be substantially affected by the proceeding under paragraph (A)(2)(c), the judge's disqualification is required. (5) A judge should disclose on the record information that the judge believes the parties or their lawyers might reasonably consider relevant to a possible motion for disqualification, even if the judge believes there is no basis for disqualification. (6) \"Economic interest,\" as set forth in the Terminology section, means ownership of more than a de minimis legal or equitable interest. Except for situations in which a judge participates in the management of such a legal or equitable interest, or the interest could be substantially affected by the outcome of a proceeding before a judge, it does not include: (1) an interest in the individual holdings within a mutual or common investment fund; (2) an interest in securities held by an educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic organization in which the judge or the judge's spouse, domestic partner, parent, or child serves as a director, officer, advisor, or other participant; (3) a deposit in a financial institution or deposits or proprietary interests the judge may maintain as a member of a mutual savings association or credit union, or similar proprietary interests; or (4) an interest in the issuer of government securities held by the judge. RULE 2.12 Supervisory Duties (A) A judge shall require court staff, court officials, and others subject to the judge's direction and control to act in a manner consistent with the judge's obligations under this Code. (B) A judge with supervisory authority for the performance of other judges shall take reasonable measures to ensure that those judges properly discharge their judicial responsibilities, including the prompt disposition of matters before them. COMMENT (1) A judge is responsible for his or her own conduct and for the conduct of others, such as staff, when those persons are acting at the judge's direction or control. A judge may not direct court personnel to engage in conduct on the judge's behalf or as the judge's representative when such conduct would violate the Code if undertaken by the judge. (2) Public confidence in the judicial system depends upon timely justice. To promote the efficient administration of justice, a judge with supervisory authority must take the steps needed to ensure that judges under his or her supervision administer their workloads promptly. RULE 2.13 Administrative Appointments (A) In making administrative appointments, a judge: (1) shall exercise the power of appointment impartially* and on the basis of merit; and (2) shall avoid nepotism, favoritism, and unnecessary appointments. (B) A judge shall not appoint a lawyer to a position if the judge either knows that the lawyer, or the lawyer's spouse or domestic partner,* has contributed more than $[insert amount] within the prior [insert number] year[s] to the judge's election campaign, or learns of such a contribution* by means of a timely motion by a party or other person properly interested in the matter, unless: (1) the position is substantially uncompensated; (2) the lawyer has been selected in rotation from a list of qualified and available lawyers compiled without regard to their having made political contributions; or (3) the judge or another presiding or administrative judge affirmatively finds that no other lawyer is willing, competent, and able to accept the position. (C) A judge shall not approve compensation of appointees beyond the fair value of services rendered. COMMENT (1) Appointees of a judge include assigned counsel, officials such as referees, commissioners, special masters, receivers, and guardians, and personnel such as clerks, secretaries, and bailiffs. Consent by the parties to an appointment or an award of compensation does not relieve the judge of the obligation prescribed by paragraph (A). (2) Unless otherwise defined by law, nepotism is the appointment or hiring of any relative within the third degree of relationship of either the judge or the judge's spouse or domestic partner, or the spouse or domestic partner of such relative. (3) The rule against making administrative appointments of lawyers who have contributed in excess of a specified dollar amount to a judge's election campaign includes an exception for positions that are substantially uncompensated, such as those for which the lawyer's compensation is limited to reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses. RULE 2.14 Disability and Impairment A judge having a reasonable belief that the performance of a lawyer or another judge is impaired by drugs or alcohol, or by a mental, emotional, or physical condition, shall take appropriate action, which may include a confidential referral to a lawyer or judicial assistance program. COMMENT (1) \"Appropriate action\" means action intended and reasonably likely to help the judge or lawyer in question address the problem and prevent harm to the justice system. Depending upon the circumstances, appropriate action may include but is not limited to speaking directly to the impaired person, notifying an individual with supervisory responsibility over the impaired person, or making a referral to an assistance program. (2) Taking or initiating corrective action by way of referral to an assistance program may satisfy a judge's responsibility under this Rule. Assistance programs have many approaches for offering help to impaired judges and lawyers, such as intervention, counseling, or referral to appropriate health care professionals. Depending upon the gravity of the conduct that has come to the judge's attention, however, the judge may be required to take other action, such as reporting the impaired judge or lawyer to the appropriate authority, agency, or body. See Rule 2.15. RULE 2.15 Responding to Judicial and Lawyer Misconduct (A) A judge having knowledge that another judge has committed a violation of this Code that raises a substantial question regarding the judge's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a judge in other respects shall inform the appropriate authority.* (B) A judge having knowledge that a lawyer has committed a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct that raises a substantial question regarding the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects shall inform the appropriate authority. (C) A judge who receives information indicating a substantial likelihood that another judge has committed a violation of this Code shall take appropriate action. (D) A judge who receives information indicating a substantial likelihood that a lawyer has committed a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct shall take appropriate action. COMMENT (1) Taking action to address known misconduct is a judge's obligation. Paragraphs (A) and (B) impose an obligation on the judge to report to the appropriate disciplinary authority the known misconduct of another judge or a lawyer that raises a substantial question regarding the honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness of that judge or lawyer. Ignoring or denying known misconduct among one's judicial colleagues or members of the legal profession undermines a judge's responsibility to participate in efforts to ensure public respect for the justice system. This Rule limits the reporting obligation to those offenses that an independent judiciary must vigorously endeavor to prevent. (2) A judge who does not have actual knowledge that another judge or a lawyer may have committed misconduct, but receives information indicating a substantial likelihood of such misconduct, is required to take appropriate action under paragraphs (C) and (D). Appropriate action may include, but is not limited to, communicating directly with the judge who may have violated this Code, communicating with a supervising judge, or reporting the suspected violation to the appropriate authority or other agency or body. Similarly, actions to be taken in response to information indicating that a lawyer has committed a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct may include but are not limited to communicating directly with the lawyer who may have committed the violation, or reporting the suspected violation to the appropriate authority or other agency or body. RULE 2.16 Cooperation with Disciplinary Authorities (A) A judge shall cooperate and be candid and honest with judicial and lawyer disciplinary agencies. (B) A judge shall not retaliate, directly or indirectly, against a person known or suspected to have assisted or cooperated with an investigation of a judge or a lawyer. COMMENT (1) Cooperation with investigations and proceedings of judicial and lawyer discipline agencies, as required in paragraph (A), instills confidence in judges' commitment to the integrity of the judicial system and the protection of the public. CANON 3 A JUDGE SHALL CONDUCT THE JUDGE'S PERSONAL AND EXTRAJUDICIAL ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF CONFLICT WITH THE OBLIGATIONS OF JUDICIAL OFFICE. RULE 3.1 Extrajudicial Activities in General A judge may engage in extrajudicial activities, except as prohibited by law or this Code. However, when engaging in extrajudicial activities, a judge shall not: (A) participate in activities that will interfere with the proper performance of the judge's judicial duties; (B) participate in activities that will lead to frequent disqualification of the judge; (C) participate in activities that would appear to a reasonable person to undermine the judge's independence,* integrity,* or impartiality;* (D) engage in conduct that would appear to a reasonable person to be coercive; or (E) make use of court premises, staff, stationery, equipment, or other resources, except for incidental use for activities that concern the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice, or unless such additional use is permitted by law. COMMENT (1) To the extent that time permits, and judicial independence and impartiality are not compromised, judges are encouraged to engage in appropriate extrajudicial activities. Judges are uniquely qualified to engage in extrajudicial activities that concern the law, the legal system, and the administration of justice, such as by speaking, writing, teaching, or participating in scholarly research projects. In addition, judges are permitted and encouraged to engage in educational, religious, charitable, fraternal or civic extrajudicial activities not conducted for profit, even when the activities do not involve the law. See Rule 3.7. (2) Participation in both law-related and other extrajudicial activities helps integrate judges into their communities, and furthers public understanding of and respect for courts and the judicial system. (3) Discriminatory actions and expressions of bias or prejudice by a judge, even outside the judge's official or judicial actions, are likely to appear to a reasonable person to call into question the judge's integrity and impartiality. Examples include jokes or other remarks that demean individuals based upon their race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status. For the same reason, a judge's extrajudicial activities must not be conducted in connection or affiliation with an organization that practices invidious discrimination. See Rule 3.6. (4) While engaged in permitted extrajudicial activities, judges must not coerce others or take action that would reasonably be perceived as coercive. For example, depending upon the circumstances, a judge's solicitation of contributions or memberships for an organization, even as permitted by Rule 3.7(A), might create the risk that the person solicited would feel obligated to respond favorably, or would do so to curry favor with the judge. RULE 3.2 Appearances before Governmental Bodies and Consultation with Government Officials A judge shall not appear voluntarily at a public hearing before, or otherwise consult with, an executive or a legislative body or official, except: (A) in connection with matters concerning the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice; (B) in connection with matters about which the judge acquired knowledge or expertise in the course of the judge's judicial duties; or (C) when the judge is acting pro se in a matter involving the judge's legal or economic interests, or when the judge is acting in a fiduciary* capacity. COMMENT (1) Judges possess special expertise in matters of law, the legal system, and the administration of justice, and may properly share that expertise with governmental bodies and executive or legislative branch officials. (2) In appearing before governmental bodies or consulting with government officials, judges must be mindful that they remain subject to other provisions of this Code, such as Rule 1.3, prohibiting judges from using the prestige of office to advance their own or others' interests, Rule 2.10, governing public comment on pending and impending matters, and Rule 3.1(C), prohibiting judges from engaging in extrajudicial activities that would appear to a reasonable person to undermine the judge's independence, integrity, or impartiality. (3) In general, it would be an unnecessary and unfair burden to prohibit judges from appearing before governmental bodies or consulting with government officials on matters that are likely to affect them as private citizens, such as zoning proposals affecting their real property. In engaging in such activities, however, judges must not refer to their judicial positions, and must otherwise exercise caution to avoid using the prestige of judicial office. RULE 3.3 Testifying as a Character Witness A judge shall not testify as a character witness in a judicial, administrative, or other adjudicatory proceeding or otherwise vouch for the character of a person in a legal proceeding, except when duly summoned. COMMENT (1) A judge who, without being subpoenaed, testifies as a character witness abuses the prestige of judicial office to advance the interests of another. See Rule 1.3. Except in unusual circumstances where the demands of justice require, a judge should discourage a party from requiring the judge to testify as a character witness. RULE 3.4 Appointments to Governmental Positions A judge shall not accept appointment to a governmental committee, board, commission, or other governmental position, unless it is one that concerns the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice. COMMENT (1) Rule 3.4 implicitly acknowledges the value of judges accepting appointments to entities that concern the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice. Even in such instances, however, a judge should assess the appropriateness of accepting an appointment, paying particular attention to the subject matter of the appointment and the availability and allocation of judicial resources, including the judge's time commitments, and giving due regard to the requirements of the independence and impartiality of the judiciary. (2) A judge may represent his or her country, state, or locality on ceremonial occasions or in connection with historical, educational, or cultural activities. Such representation does not constitute acceptance of a government position. RULE 3.5 Use of Nonpublic Information A judge shall not intentionally disclose or use nonpublic information* acquired in a judicial capacity for any purpose unrelated to the judge's judicial duties. COMMENT (1) In the course of performing judicial duties, a judge may acquire information of commercial or other value that is unavailable to the public. The judge must not reveal or use such information for personal gain or for any purpose unrelated to his or her judicial duties. (2) This rule is not intended, however, to affect a judge's ability to act on information as necessary to protect the health or safety of the judge or a member of a judge's family, court personnel, or other judicial officers if consistent with other provisions of this Code. RULE 3.6 Affiliation with Discriminatory Organizations (A) A judge shall not hold membership in any organization that practices invidious discrimination on the basis of race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. (B) A judge shall not use the benefits or facilities of an organization if the judge knows or should know that the organization practices invidious discrimination on one or more of the bases identified in paragraph (A). A judge's attendance at an event in a facility of an organization that the judge is not permitted to join is not a violation of this Rule when the judge's attendance is an isolated event that could not reasonably be perceived as an endorsement of the organization's practices. COMMENT (1) A judge's public manifestation of approval of invidious discrimination on any basis gives rise to the appearance of impropriety and diminishes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. A judge's membership in an organization that practices invidious discrimination creates the perception that the judge's impartiality is impaired. (2) An organization is generally said to discriminate invidiously if it arbitrarily excludes from membership on the basis of race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, or sexual orientation persons who would otherwise be eligible for admission. Whether an organization practices invidious discrimination is a complex question to which judges should be attentive. The answer cannot be determined from a mere examination of an organization's current membership rolls, but rather, depends upon how the organization selects members, as well as other relevant factors, such as whether the organization is dedicated to the preservation of religious, ethnic, or cultural values of legitimate common interest to its members, or whether it is an intimate, purely private organization whose membership limitations could not constitutionally be prohibited. (3) When a judge learns that an organization to which the judge belongs engages in invidious discrimination, the judge must resign immediately from the organization. (4) A judge's membership in a religious organization as a lawful exercise of the freedom of religion is not a violation of this Rule. (5) This Rule does not apply to national or state military service. RULE 3.7 Participation in Educational, Religious, Charitable, Fraternal, or Civic Organizations and Activities (A) Subject to the requirements of Rule 3.1, a judge may participate in activities sponsored by organizations or governmental entities concerned with the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice, and those sponsored by or on behalf of educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic organizations not conducted for profit, including but not limited to the following activities: (1) assisting such an organization or entity in planning related to fund-raising, and participating in the management and investment of the organization's or entity's funds; (2) soliciting contributions* for such an organization or entity, but only from members of the judge's family,* or from judges over whom the judge does not exercise supervisory or appellate authority; (3) soliciting membership for such an organization or entity, even though the membership dues or fees generated may be used to support the objectives of the organization or entity, but only if the organization or entity is concerned with the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice; (4) appearing or speaking at, receiving an award or other recognition at, being featured on the program of, and permitting his or her title to be used in connection with an event of such an organization or entity, but if the event serves a fund-raising purpose, the judge may participate only if the event concerns the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice; (5) making recommendations to such a public or private fund- granting organization or entity in connection with its programs and activities, but only if the organization or entity is concerned with the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice; and (6) serving as an officer, director, trustee, or nonlegal advisor of such an organization or entity, unless it is likely that the organization or entity: (a) will be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before the judge; or (b) will frequently be engaged in adversary proceedings in the court of which the judge is a member, or in any court subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the court of which the judge is a member. (B) A judge may encourage lawyers to provide pro bono publico legal services. COMMENT (1) The activities permitted by paragraph (A) generally include those sponsored by or undertaken on behalf of public or private not-for-profit educational institutions, and other not-for-profit organizations, including law-related, charitable, and other organizations. (2) Even for law-related organizations, a judge should consider whether the membership and purposes of the organization, or the nature of the judge's participation in or association with the organization, would conflict with the judge's obligation to refrain from activities that reflect adversely upon a judge's independence, integrity, and impartiality. (3) Mere attendance at an event, whether or not the event serves a fund-raising purpose, does not constitute a violation of paragraph A (4). It is also generally permissible for a judge to serve as an usher or a food server or preparer, or to perform similar functions, at fund-raising events sponsored by educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic organizations. Such activities are not solicitation and do not present an element of coercion or abuse the prestige of judicial office. (4) Identification of a judge's position in educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic organizations on letterhead used for fund-raising or membership solicitation does not violate this Rule. The letterhead may list the judge's title or judicial office if comparable designations are used for other persons. (5) In addition to appointing lawyers to serve as counsel for indigent parties in individual cases, a judge may promote broader access to justice by encouraging lawyers to participate in pro bono publico legal services, if in doing so the judge does not employ coercion, or abuse the prestige of judicial office. Such encouragement may take many forms, including providing lists of available programs, training lawyers to do pro bono publico legal work, and participating in events recognizing lawyers who have done pro bono publico work. RULE 3.8 Appointments to Fiduciary Positions (A) A judge shall not accept appointment to serve in a fiduciary* position, such as executor, administrator, trustee, guardian, attorney in fact, or other personal representative, except for the estate, trust, or person of a member of the judge's family,* and then only if such service will not interfere with the proper performance of judicial duties. (B) A judge shall not serve in a fiduciary position if the judge as fiduciary will likely be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before the judge, or if the estate, trust, or ward becomes involved in adversary proceedings in the court on which the judge serves, or one under its appellate jurisdiction. (C) A judge acting in a fiduciary capacity shall be subject to the same restrictions on engaging in financial activities that apply to a judge personally. (D) If a person who is serving in a fiduciary position becomes a judge, he or she must comply with this Rule as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than [one year] after becoming a judge. COMMENT (1) A judge should recognize that other restrictions imposed by this Code may conflict with a judge's obligations as a fiduciary; in such circumstances, a judge should resign as fiduciary. For example, serving as a fiduciary might require frequent disqualification of a judge under Rule 2.11 because a judge is deemed to have an economic interest in shares of stock held by a trust if the amount of stock held is more than de minimis. RULE 3.9 Service as Arbitrator or Mediator A judge shall not act as an arbitrator or a mediator or perform other judicial functions apart from the judge's official duties unless expressly authorized by law.* COMMENT (1) This Rule does not prohibit a judge from participating in arbitration, mediation, or settlement conferences performed as part of assigned judicial duties. Rendering dispute resolution services apart from those duties, whether or not for economic gain, is prohibited unless it is expressly authorized by law. RULE 3.10 Practice of Law A judge shall not practice law. A judge may act pro se and may, without compensation, give legal advice to and draft or review documents for a member of the judge's family,* but is prohibited from serving as the family member's lawyer in any forum. COMMENT (1) A judge may act pro se in all legal matters, including matters involving litigation and matters involving appearances before or other dealings with governmental bodies. A judge must not use the prestige of office to advance the judge's personal or family interests. See Rule 1.3. RULE 3.11 Financial, Business, or Remunerative Activities (A) A judge may hold and manage investments of the judge and members of the judge's family.* (B) A judge shall not serve as an officer, director, manager, general partner, advisor, or employee of any business entity except that a judge may manage or participate in: (1) a business closely held by the judge or members of the judge's family; or (2) a business entity primarily engaged in investment of the financial resources of the judge or members of the judge's family. (C) A judge shall not engage in financial activities permitted under paragraphs (A) and (B) if they will: (1) interfere with the proper performance of judicial duties; (2) lead to frequent disqualification of the judge; (3) involve the judge in frequent transactions or continuing business relationships with lawyers or other persons likely to come before the court on which the judge serves; or (4) result in violation of other provisions of this Code. COMMENT (1) Judges are generally permitted to engage in financial activities, including managing real estate and other investments for themselves or for members of their families. Participation in these activities, like participation in other extrajudicial activities, is subject to the requirements of this Code. For example, it would be improper for a judge to spend so much time on business activities that it interferes with the performance of judicial duties. See Rule 2.1. Similarly, it would be improper for a judge to use his or her official title or appear in judicial robes in business advertising, or to conduct his or her business or financial affairs in such a way that disqualification is frequently required. See Rules 1.3 and 2.11. (2) As soon as practicable without serious financial detriment, the judge must divest himself or herself of investments and other financial interests that might require frequent disqualification or otherwise violate this Rule. RULE 3.12 Compensation for Extrajudicial Activities A judge may accept reasonable compensation for extrajudicial activities permitted by this Code or other law* unless such acceptance would appear to a reasonable person to undermine the judge's independence,* integrity,* or impartiality.* COMMENT (1) A judge is permitted to accept honoraria, stipends, fees, wages, salaries, royalties, or other compensation for speaking, teaching, writing, and other extrajudicial activities, provided the compensation is reasonable and commensurate with the task performed. The judge should be mindful, however, that judicial duties must take precedence over other activities. See Rule 2.1. (2) Compensation derived from extrajudicial activities may be subject to public reporting. See Rule 3.15. RULE 3.13 Acceptance and Reporting of Gifts, Loans, Bequests, Benefits, or Other Things of Value (A) A judge shall not accept any gifts, loans, bequests, benefits, or other things of value, if acceptance is prohibited by law or would appear to a reasonable person to undermine the judge's independence,* integrity,* or impartiality.* (B) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, or by paragraph (A), a judge may accept the following without publicly reporting such acceptance: (1) items with little intrinsic value, such as plaques, certificates, trophies, and greeting cards; (2) gifts, loans, bequests, benefits, or other things of value from friends, relatives, or other persons, including lawyers, whose appearance or interest in a proceeding pending* or impending* before the judge would in any event require disqualification of the judge under Rule 2.11; (3) ordinary social hospitality; (4) commercial or financial opportunities and benefits, including special pricing and discounts, and loans from lending institutions in their regular course of business, if the same opportunities and benefits or loans are made available on the same terms to similarly situated persons who are not judges; (5) rewards and prizes given to competitors or participants in random drawings, contests, or other events that are open to persons who are not judges; (6) scholarships, fellowships, and similar benefits or awards, if they are available to similarly situated persons who are not judges, based upon the same terms and criteria; (7) books, magazines, journals, audiovisual materials, and other resource materials supplied by publishers on a complimentary basis for official use; or (8) gifts, awards, or benefits associated with the business, profession, or other separate activity of a spouse, a domestic partner,* or other family member of a judge residing in the judge's household,* but that incidentally benefit the judge. (C) Unless otherwise prohibited by law or by paragraph (A), a judge may accept the following items, and must report such acceptance to the extent required by Rule 3.15: (1) gifts incident to a public testimonial; (2) invitations to the judge and the judge's spouse, domestic partner, or guest to attend without charge: (a) an event associated with a bar-related function or other activity relating to the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice; or (b) an event associated with any of the judge's educational, religious, charitable, fraternal or civic activities permitted by this Code, if the same invitation is offered to nonjudges who are engaged in similar ways in the activity as is the judge; and (3) gifts, loans, bequests, benefits, or other things of value, if the source is a party or other person, including a lawyer, who has come or is likely to come before the judge, or whose interests have come or are likely to come before the judge. COMMENT (1) Whenever a judge accepts a gift or other thing of value without paying fair market value, there is a risk that the benefit might be viewed as intended to influence the judge's decision in a case. Rule 3.13 imposes restrictions upon the acceptance of such benefits, according to the magnitude of the risk. Paragraph (B) identifies circumstances in which the risk that the acceptance would appear to undermine the judge's independence, integrity, or impartiality is low, and explicitly provides that such items need not be publicly reported. As the value of the benefit or the likelihood that the source of the benefit will appear before the judge increases, the judge is either prohibited under paragraph (A) from accepting the gift, or required under paragraph (C) to publicly report it. (2) Gift-giving between friends and relatives is a common occurrence, and ordinarily does not create an appearance of impropriety or cause reasonable persons to believe that the judge's independence, integrity, or impartiality has been compromised. In addition, when the appearance of friends or relatives in a case would require the judge's disqualification under Rule 2.11, there would be no opportunity for a gift to influence the judge's decision making. Paragraph (B)(2) places no restrictions upon the ability of a judge to accept gifts or other things of value from friends or relatives under these circumstances, and does not require public reporting. (3) Businesses and financial institutions frequently make available special pricing, discounts, and other benefits, either in connection with a temporary promotion or for preferred customers, based upon longevity of the relationship, volume of business transacted, and other factors. A judge may freely accept such benefits if they are available to the general public, or if the judge qualifies for the special price or discount according to the same criteria as are applied to persons who are not judges. As an example, loans provided at generally prevailing interest rates are not gifts, but a judge could not accept a loan from a financial institution at below-market interest rates unless the same rate was being made available to the general public for a certain period of time or only to borrowers with specified qualifications that the judge also possesses. (4) Rule 3.13 applies only to acceptance of gifts or other things of value by a judge. Nonetheless, if a gift or other benefit is given to the judge's spouse, domestic partner, or member of the judge's family residing in the judge's household, it may be viewed as an attempt to evade Rule 3.13 and influence the judge indirectly. Where the gift or benefit is being made primarily to such other persons, and the judge is merely an incidental beneficiary, this concern is reduced. A judge should, however, remind family and household members of the restrictions imposed upon judges, and urge them to take these restrictions into account when making decisions about accepting such gifts or benefits. (5) Rule 3.13 does not apply to contributions to a judge's campaign for judicial office. Such contributions are governed by other Rules of this Code, including Rules 4.3 and 4.4. RULE 3.14 Reimbursement of Expenses and Waivers of Fees or Charges (A) Unless otherwise prohibited by Rules 3.1 and 3.13(A) or other law,* a judge may accept reimbursement of necessary and reasonable expenses for travel, food, lodging, or other incidental expenses, or a waiver or partial waiver of fees or charges for registration, tuition, and similar items, from sources other than the judge's employing entity, if the expenses or charges are associated with the judge's participation in extrajudicial activities permitted by this Code. (B) Reimbursement of expenses for necessary travel, food, lodging, or other incidental expenses shall be limited to the actual costs reasonably incurred by the judge and, when appropriate to the occasion, by the judge's spouse, domestic partner,* or guest. (C) A judge who accepts reimbursement of expenses or waivers or partial waivers of fees or charges on behalf of the judge or the judge's spouse, domestic partner, or guest shall publicly report such acceptance as required by Rule 3.15. COMMENT (1) Educational, civic, religious, fraternal, and charitable organizations often sponsor meetings, seminars, symposia, dinners, awards ceremonies, and similar events. Judges are encouraged to attend educational programs, as both teachers and participants, in law- related and academic disciplines, in furtherance of their duty to remain competent in the law. Participation in a variety of other extrajudicial activity is also permitted and encouraged by this Code. (2) Not infrequently, sponsoring organizations invite certain judges to attend seminars or other events on a fee-waived or partial-fee-waived basis, and sometimes include reimbursement for necessary travel, food, lodging, or other incidental expenses. A judge's decision whether to accept reimbursement of expenses or a waiver or partial waiver of fees or charges in connection with these or other extrajudicial activities must be based upon an assessment of all the circumstances. The judge must undertake a reasonable inquiry to obtain the information necessary to make an informed judgment about whether acceptance would be consistent with the requirements of this Code. (3) A judge must assure himself or herself that acceptance of reimbursement or fee waivers would not appear to a reasonable person to undermine the judge's independence, integrity, or impartiality. The factors that a judge should consider when deciding whether to accept reimbursement or a fee waiver for attendance at a particular activity include: (a) whether the sponsor is an accredited educational institution or bar association rather than a trade association or a for-profit entity; (b) whether the funding comes largely from numerous contributors rather than from a single entity and is earmarked for programs with specific content; (c) whether the content is related or unrelated to the subject matter of litigation pending or impending before the judge, or to matters that are likely to come before the judge; (d) whether the activity is primarily educational rather than recreational, and whether the costs of the event are reasonable and comparable to those associated with similar events sponsored by the judiciary, bar associations, or similar groups; (e) whether information concerning the activity and its funding sources is available upon inquiry; (f) whether the sponsor or source of funding is generally associated with particular parties or interests currently appearing or likely to appear in the judge's court, thus possibly requiring disqualification of the judge under Rule 2.11; (g) whether differing viewpoints are presented; and (h) whether a broad range of judicial and nonjudicial participants are invited, whether a large number of participants are invited, and whether the program is designed specifically for judges. RULE 3.15 Reporting Requirements (A) A judge shall publicly report the amount or value of: (1) compensation received for extrajudicial activities as permitted by Rule 3.12; (2) gifts and other things of value as permitted by Rule 3.13(C), unless the value of such items, alone or in the aggregate with other items received from the same source in the same calendar year, does not exceed $[insert amount]; and (3) reimbursement of expenses and waiver of fees or charges permitted by Rule 3.14(A), unless the amount of reimbursement or waiver, alone or in the aggregate with other reimbursements or waivers received from the same source in the same calendar year, does not exceed $[insert amount]. (B) When public reporting is required by paragraph (A), a judge shall report the date, place, and nature of the activity for which the judge received any compensation; the description of any gift, loan, bequest, benefit, or other thing of value accepted; and the source of reimbursement of expenses or waiver or partial waiver of fees or charges. (C) The public report required by paragraph (A) shall be made at least annually, except that for reimbursement of expenses and waiver or partial waiver of fees or charges, the report shall be made within thirty days following the conclusion of the event or program. (D) Reports made in compliance with this Rule shall be filed as public documents in the office of the clerk of the court on which the judge serves or other office designated by law,* and, when technically feasible, posted by the court or office personnel on the court's website. CANON 4 A JUDGE OR CANDIDATE FOR JUDICIAL OFFICE SHALL NOT ENGAGE IN POLITICAL OR CAMPAIGN ACTIVITY THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE INDEPENDENCE, INTEGRITY, OR IMPARTIALITY OF THE JUDICIARY. RULE 4.1 Political and Campaign Activities of Judges and Judicial Candidates in General (A) Except as permitted by law,* or by Rules 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4, a judge or a judicial candidate* shall not: (1) act as a leader in, or hold an office in, a political organization;* (2) make speeches on behalf of a political organization; (3) publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for any public office; (4) solicit funds for, pay an assessment to, or make a contribution* to a political organization or a candidate for public office; (5) attend or purchase tickets for dinners or other events sponsored by a political organization or a candidate for public office; (6) publicly identify himself or herself as a candidate of a political organization; (7) seek, accept, or use endorsements from a political organization; (8) personally solicit* or accept campaign contributions other than through a campaign committee authorized by Rule 4.4; (9) use or permit the use of campaign contributions for the private benefit of the judge, the candidate, or others; (10) use court staff, facilities, or other court resources in a campaign for judicial office; (11) knowingly,* or with reckless disregard for the truth, make any false or misleading statement; (12) make any statement that would reasonably be expected to affect the outcome or impair the fairness of a matter pending* or impending in any court; or (13) in connection with cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come before the court, make pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial* performance of the adjudicative duties of judicial office. (B) A judge or judicial candidate shall take reasonable measures to ensure that other persons do not undertake, on behalf of the judge or judicial candidate, any activities prohibited under paragraph (A). COMMENT GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS (1) Even when subject to public election, a judge plays a role different from that of a legislator or executive branch official. Rather than making decisions based upon the expressed views or preferences of the electorate, a judge makes decisions based upon the law and the facts of every case. Therefore, in furtherance of this interest, judges and judicial candidates must, to the greatest extent possible, be free and appear to be free from political influence and political pressure. This Canon imposes narrowly tailored restrictions upon the political and campaign activities of all judges and judicial candidates, taking into account the various methods of selecting judges. (2) When a person becomes a judicial candidate, this Canon becomes applicable to his or her conduct. PARTICIPATION IN POLITICAL ACTIVITIES (3) Public confidence in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary is eroded if judges or judicial candidates are perceived to be subject to political influence. Although judges and judicial candidates may register to vote as members of a political party, they are prohibited by paragraph (A)(1) from assuming leadership roles in political organizations. (4) Paragraphs (A)(2) and (A)(3) prohibit judges and judicial candidates from making speeches on behalf of political organizations or publicly endorsing or opposing candidates for public office, respectively, to prevent them from abusing the prestige of judicial office to advance the interests of others. See Rule 1.3. These Rules do not prohibit candidates from campaigning on their own behalf, or from endorsing or opposing candidates for the same judicial office for which they are running. See Rules 4.2(B)(2) and 4.2(B)(3). (5) Although members of the families of judges and judicial candidates are free to engage in their own political activity, including running for public office, there is no \"family exception\" to the prohibition in paragraph (A)(3) against a judge or candidate publicly endorsing candidates for public office. A judge or judicial candidate must not become involved in, or publicly associated with, a family member's political activity or campaign for public office. To avoid public misunderstanding, judges and judicial candidates should take, and should urge members of their families to take, reasonable steps to avoid any implication that they endorse any family member's candidacy or other political activity. (6) Judges and judicial candidates retain the right to participate in the political process as voters in both primary and general elections. For purposes of this Canon, participation in a caucus-type election procedure does not constitute public support for or endorsement of a political organization or candidate, and is not prohibited by paragraphs (A)(2) or (A)(3). STATEMENTS AND COMMENTS MADE DURING A CAMPAIGN FOR JUDICIAL OFFICE (7) Judicial candidates must be scrupulously fair and accurate in all statements made by them and by their campaign committees. Paragraph (A)(11) obligates candidates and their committees to refrain from making statements that are false or misleading, or that omit facts necessary to make the communication considered as a whole not materially misleading. (8) Judicial candidates are sometimes the subject of false, misleading, or unfair allegations made by opposing candidates, third parties, or the media. For example, false or misleading statements might be made regarding the identity, present position, experience, qualifications, or judicial rulings of a candidate. In other situations, false or misleading allegations may be made that bear upon a candidate's integrity or fitness for judicial office. As long as the candidate does not violate paragraphs (A)(11), (A)(12), or (A)(13), the candidate may make a factually accurate public response. In addition, when an independent third party has made unwarranted attacks on a candidate's opponent, the candidate may disavow the attacks, and request the third party to cease and desist. (9) Subject to paragraph (A)(12), a judicial candidate is permitted to respond directly to false, misleading, or unfair allegations made against him or her during a campaign, although it is preferable for someone else to respond if the allegations relate to a pending case. (10) Paragraph (A)(12) prohibits judicial candidates from making comments that might impair the fairness of pending or impending judicial proceedings. This provision does not restrict arguments or statements to the court or jury by a lawyer who is a judicial candidate, or rulings, statements, or instructions by a judge that may appropriately affect the outcome of a matter. PLEDGES, PROMISES, OR COMMITMENTS INCONSISTENT WITH IMPARTIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE ADJUDICATIVE DUTIES OF JUDICIAL OFFICE (11) The role of a judge is different from that of a legislator or executive branch official, even when the judge is subject to public election. Campaigns for judicial office must be conducted differently from campaigns for other offices. The narrowly drafted restrictions upon political and campaign activities of judicial candidates provided in Canon 4 allow candidates to conduct campaigns that provide voters with sufficient information to permit them to distinguish between candidates and make informed electoral choices. (12) Paragraph (A)(13) makes applicable to both judges and judicial candidates the prohibition that applies to judges in Rule 2.10(B), relating to pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of judicial office. (13) The making of a pledge, promise, or commitment is not dependent upon, or limited to, the use of any specific words or phrases; instead, the totality of the statement must be examined to determine if a reasonable person would believe that the candidate for judicial office has specifically undertaken to reach a particular result. Pledges, promises, or commitments must be contrasted with statements or announcements of personal views on legal, political, or other issues, which are not prohibited. When making such statements, a judge should acknowledge the overarching judicial obligation to apply and uphold the law, without regard to his or her personal views. (14) A judicial candidate may make campaign promises related to judicial organization, administration, and court management, such as a promise to dispose of a backlog of cases, start court sessions on time, or avoid favoritism in appointments and hiring. A candidate may also pledge to take action outside the courtroom, such as working toward an improved jury selection system, or advocating for more funds to improve the physical plant and amenities of the courthouse. (15) Judicial candidates may receive questionnaires or requests for interviews from the media and from issue advocacy or other community organizations that seek to learn their views on disputed or controversial legal or political issues. Paragraph (A)(13) does not specifically address judicial responses to such inquiries. Depending upon the wording and format of such questionnaires, candidates' responses might be viewed as pledges, promises, or commitments to perform the adjudicative duties of office other than in an impartial way. To avoid violating paragraph (A)(13), therefore, candidates who respond to media and other inquiries should also give assurances that they will keep an open mind and will carry out their adjudicative duties faithfully and impartially if elected. Candidates who do not respond may state their reasons for not responding, such as the danger that answering might be perceived by a reasonable person as undermining a successful candidate's independence or impartiality, or that it might lead to frequent disqualification. See Rule 2.11. RULE 4.2 Political and Campaign Activities of Judicial Candidates in Public Elections (A) A judicial candidate* in a partisan, nonpartisan, or retention public election* shall: (1) act at all times in a manner consistent with the independence,* integrity, and impartiality* of the judiciary; (2) comply with all applicable election, election campaign, and election campaign fund-raising laws and regulations of this jurisdiction; (3) review and approve the content of all campaign statements and materials produced by the candidate or his or her campaign committee, as authorized by Rule 4.4, before their dissemination; and (4) take reasonable measures to ensure that other persons do not undertake on behalf of the candidate activities, other than those described in Rule 4.4, that the candidate is prohibited from doing by Rule 4.1. (B) A candidate for elective judicial office may, unless prohibited by law,* and not earlier than [insert amount of time] before the first applicable primary election, caucus, or general or retention election: (1) establish a campaign committee pursuant to the provisions of Rule 4.4; (2) speak on behalf of his or her candidacy through any medium, including but not limited to advertisements, websites, or other campaign literature; (3) publicly endorse or oppose candidates for the same judicial office for which he or she is running; (4) attend or purchase tickets for dinners or other events sponsored by a political organization* or a candidate for public office; (5) seek, accept, or use endorsements from any person or organization other than a partisan political organization; and (6) contribute to a political organization or candidate for public office, but not more than $[insert amount] to any one organization or candidate. (C) A judicial candidate in a partisan public election may, unless prohibited by law, and not earlier than [insert amount of time] before the first applicable primary election, caucus, or general election: (1) identify himself or herself as a candidate of a political organization; and (2) seek, accept, and use endorsements of a political organization. COMMENT (1) Paragraphs (B) and (C) permit judicial candidates in public elections to engage in some political and campaign activities otherwise prohibited by Rule 4.1. Candidates may not engage in these activities earlier than [insert amount of time] before the first applicable electoral event, such as a caucus or a primary election. (2) Despite paragraphs (B) and (C), judicial candidates for public election remain subject to many of the provisions of Rule 4.1. For example, a candidate continues to be prohibited from soliciting funds for a political organization, knowingly making false or misleading statements during a campaign, or making certain promises, pledges, or commitments related to future adjudicative duties. See Rule 4.1(A), paragraphs (4), (11), and (13). (3) In partisan public elections for judicial office, a candidate may be nominated by, affiliated with, or otherwise publicly identified or associated with a political organization, including a political party. This relationship may be maintained throughout the period of the public campaign, and may include use of political party or similar designations on campaign literature and on the ballot. (4) In nonpartisan public elections or retention elections, paragraph (B)(5) prohibits a candidate from seeking, accepting, or using nominations or endorsements from a partisan political organization. (5) Judicial candidates are permitted to attend or purchase tickets for dinners and other events sponsored by political organizations. (6) For purposes of paragraph (B)(3), candidates are considered to be running for the same judicial office if they are competing for a single judgeship or if several judgeships on the same court are to be filled as a result of the election. In endorsing or opposing another candidate for a position on the same court, a judicial candidate must abide by the same rules governing campaign conduct and speech as apply to the candidate's own campaign. (7) Although judicial candidates in nonpartisan public elections are prohibited from running on a ticket or slate associated with a political organization, they may group themselves into slates or other alliances to conduct their campaigns more effectively. Candidates who have grouped themselves together are considered to be running for the same judicial office if they satisfy the conditions described in Comment (6). RULE 4.3 Activities of Candidates for Appointive Judicial Office A candidate for appointment to judicial office may: (A) communicate with the appointing or confirming authority, including any selection, screening, or nominating commission or similar agency; and (B) seek endorsements for the appointment from any person or organization other than a partisan political organization. COMMENT (1) When seeking support or endorsement, or when communicating directly with an appointing or confirming authority, a candidate for appointive judicial office must not make any pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of the office. See Rule 4.1(A)(13). RULE 4.4 Campaign Committees (A) A judicial candidate* subject to public election* may establish a campaign committee to manage and conduct a campaign for the candidate, subject to the provisions of this Code. The candidate is responsible for ensuring that his or her campaign committee complies with applicable provisions of this Code and other applicable law.* (B) A judicial candidate subject to public election shall direct his or her campaign committee: (1) to solicit and accept only such campaign contributions* as are reasonable, in any event not to exceed, in the aggregate,* $[insert amount] from any individual or $[insert amount] from any entity or organization; (2) not to solicit or accept contributions for a candidate's current campaign more than [insert amount of time] before the applicable primary election, caucus, or general or retention election, nor more than [insert number] days after the last election in which the candidate participated; and (3) to comply with all applicable statutory requirements for disclosure and divestiture of campaign contributions, and to file with [name of appropriate regulatory authority] a report stating the name, address, occupation, and employer of each person who has made campaign contributions to the committee in an aggregate value exceeding $[insert amount]. The report must be filed within [insert number] days following an election, or within such other period as is provided by law. COMMENT (1) Judicial candidates are prohibited from personally soliciting campaign contributions or personally accepting campaign contributions. See Rule 4.1(A)(8). This Rule recognizes that in many jurisdictions, judicial candidates must raise campaign funds to support their candidacies, and permits candidates, other than candidates for appointive judicial office, to establish campaign committees to solicit and accept reasonable financial contributions or in-kind contributions. (2) Campaign committees may solicit and accept campaign contributions, manage the expenditure of campaign funds, and generally conduct campaigns. Candidates are responsible for compliance with the requirements of election law and other applicable law, and for the activities of their campaign committees. (3) At the start of a campaign, the candidate must instruct the campaign committee to solicit or accept only such contributions as are reasonable in amount, appropriate under the circumstances, and in conformity with applicable law. Although lawyers and others who might appear before a successful candidate for judicial office are permitted to make campaign contributions, the candidate should instruct his or her campaign committee to be especially cautious in connection with such contributions, so they do not create grounds for disqualification if the candidate is elected to judicial office. See Rule 2.11. RULE 4.5 Activities of Judges Who Become Candidates for Nonjudicial Office (A) Upon becoming a candidate for a nonjudicial elective office, a judge shall resign from judicial office, unless permitted by law* to continue to hold judicial office. (B) Upon becoming a candidate for a nonjudicial appointive office, a judge is not required to resign from judicial office, provided that the judge complies with the other provisions of this Code. COMMENT (1) In campaigns for nonjudicial elective public office, candidates may make pledges, promises, or commitments related to positions they would take and ways they would act if elected to office. Although appropriate in nonjudicial campaigns, this manner of campaigning is inconsistent with the role of a judge, who must remain fair and impartial to all who come before him or her. The potential for misuse of the judicial office, and the political promises that the judge would be compelled to make in the course of campaigning for nonjudicial elective office, together dictate that a judge who wishes to run for such an office must resign upon becoming a candidate. (2) The \"resign to run\" rule set forth in paragraph (A) ensures that a judge cannot use the judicial office to promote his or her candidacy, and prevents post-campaign retaliation from the judge in the event the judge is defeated in the election. When a judge is seeking appointive nonjudicial office, however, the dangers are not sufficient to warrant imposing the \"resign to run\" rule.", "num": "KL-CY-2017-007", "path": "library|us/nsn/kiowa/council/resolutions|2017|Kiowa Tribe Res.
